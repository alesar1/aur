The Firestorm team highly recommends to delete the old configuration
after an upgrade.  This may be accomplished by deleting \$HOME/.firestorm

Remember, chat logs are saved in that directory, so make sure to backup
any *.txt files you want to keep.

There is an official mechanism to backup and restore settings for an
upgrade, but you need to do it _before_ upgrading this package.
See http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/backup_settings for details.

CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:315 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.

CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (SNAPPY)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Snappy).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0071 is not set: Let AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC process GENERATED files.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0071" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility, CMake is excluding the GENERATED source file(s):

    "/build/knossos/src/build-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-knossos/buildinfo.h"

  from processing by AUTOMOC and AUTOUIC.  If any of the files should be
  processed, set CMP0071 to NEW.  If any of the files should not be
  processed, explicitly exclude them by setting the source file property
  SKIP_AUTOGEN:

    set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

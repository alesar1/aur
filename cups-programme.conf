# su_variant:
# 
# Controls which programme is selected to use to run a command as
# another user.
# 
# When the print backend is run, there is no terminal input, so no
# password can be entered easily.
# 
# So you need to either configure sudo such that you do not need a
# password and use a sudo-based su_variant, or select a su_variant which
# gives a graphical password prompt.
# 
# 'su' is most probably only usefull if no password will be asked for
# in general, e.g. when CUPS is running it's backends as root.
# 
# Possible values for su_variant are:
# - 'su' -- uses 'su', also allows to change the group. Not graphical,
#   so only useful if no password is required in the first place.
# - 'sudo' -- uses 'sudo', also allows to change the group. Not
#   graphical, so only useful if no password is required. sudo can be
#   configured to allow specific commands as specific users without
#   password (e.g. in /etc/sudoers, /etc/sudoers.d).
# - 'sudo-askpass' -- uses 'sudo' with an external command to ask for
#   the password. Also allows to change the group. The external askpass
#   command needs to be specified in $askpass_cmd. May be a graphical
#   programme.
# - 'kdesu' -- uses 'kdesu', does not allow to change the group.
#   Graphical.
# - 'kdesudo' -- uses 'kdesudo', does not allow to change the group.
#   Graphical.
# 
# Note that changing the group is in all cases only possible if CUPS
# runs the printing backend as root, which most probably is not the
# case.

# askpass programme to use when $su_variant is set to 'sudo-askpass'.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: wm8962: Fix suspend while playing music

[ Upstream commit d1f5272c0f7d2e53c6f2480f46725442776f5f78 ]

If the audio CODEC is playing sound when the system is suspended,
it can be left in a state which throws the following error:

wm8962 3-001a: ASoC: error at soc_component_read_no_lock on wm8962.3-001a: -16

Once this error has occurred, the audio will not work again until rebooted.

Fix this by configuring SET_SYSTEM_SLEEP_PM_OPS.

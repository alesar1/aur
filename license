6. Your Statutory Rights

This Licence Agreement gives you specific legal rights. You may also have other rights that vary from one country to another.

If any part of the limitations or exclusions in this Licence Agreement is held to be void or unenforceable, such part shall be deemed to be deleted from this Licence Agreement and the remainder of the limitation or exclusion shall continue in full force and effect.

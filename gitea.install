It seems that in 1.12, gitea has changed the data load behavior.
If you’re using the default paths (/var/lib/gitea),
no changes are necessary.
If you’re using custom paths, you might have to set then with
-w for working directory and/or -C for gitea/custom directory.
Refer to gitea --help if you’re experiencing any issues.

# RSA key size, in bits

# Expected hash values
# Note: These are calculated for you each time mkinitcpio
# runs. The only time you would want to uncomment these is
# if the logic in the install hook incorrectly detects your
# configuration and you want to override the logic.

# The hash of the MBR

# The hash of the Post-MBR Gap
# (bytes from the end of the MBR to the start of the first partition)
# expected_mbr_gap_hash=

# The hash of the EFI stub used to boot
# (hash of the file invoked by the UEFI firmware, likely /EFI/grub/grubx64.efi)
# Note: Only checked when booting via UEFI
# Note: MBR and Post MBR Gap are still checked when booting via UEFI

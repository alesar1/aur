s legal rights in relation to any Software or Documentation that is faulty or not as described.

12.2 Foundry does not warrant that the Software or Documentation will meet Licensee's requireme
nts or that Licensee's use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free.

12.3 If Licensee purchases a license of the Software that is of a fixed term duration, the Warr
anty Period in clause 12.1 shall apply only to Licensee's first purchase of such license and no
t to any subsequent renewal(s) even if a renewal involves another download.

13.  INDEMNIFICATION

Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Foundry, the Third Party Licensors and F
oundry's and each Third Party Licensor's respective affiliates, officers, directors, shareholde
rs, employees, authorized resellers, agents and other representatives from all claims, defence
costs (including, but not limited to, legal fees), judgments, settlements and other expenses ar
ising from or connected with any claim that any authorised or unauthorised modification of the
Software or Documentation by
Licensee or any person connected with Licensee infringes the intellectual property rights or ot
her proprietary rights of any third party.

14.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO BUSINESS USERS

This clause applies where Licensee is a business user (and for these purposes any Licensee that
 is not a consumer shall be treated as a business user). Licensee acknowledges that the Softwar
e has not been developed to meet its individual requirements, and that it is therefore Licensee
's responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in t
he Documentation meet such requirements. The Software and Documentation is supplied only for Li
censee's internal use for its
business, and not for any re-sale purposes or for the provision of the Software (whether direct
ly or indirectly) to third parties. Foundry shall not under any circumstances whatever be liabl
e to Licensee, its affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents or other re
presentatives, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or o
therwise, arising under or in connection with the Agreement for loss of profits, sales, busines
s, or revenue, business
interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss or corruption of data or information, loss of b
usiness opportunity, goodwill or reputation (in each case whether the loss is direct or indirec
t) or any indirect or consequential loss or damage. In respect of any other losses, Foundry's m
aximum aggregate liability under or in connection with the Agreement whether in contract, tort
(including negligence) or otherwise, shall in all circumstances be limited to the greater of US
$5,000 (five thousand USD) and a sum
equal to the License Fee. Nothing in the Agreement shall limit or exclude Foundry's liability f
or death or personal injury resulting from our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresent
ation or for any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law. This EUL
A sets out the full extent of our obligations and liabilities in respect of the supply of the S
oftware and Documentation. Except as expressly stated in writing in this EULA, there are no con
ditions, warranties, representations
or other terms, express or implied, that are binding on Foundry.  Any condition, warranty, repr
esentation or other term concerning the supply of the Software and Documentation which might ot
herwise be implied into, or incorporated in, the Agreement, whether by statute, common law or o
therwise, is excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.

15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY TO CONSUMERS

This clause applies where Licensee is a consumer. Licensee acknowledges that the Software has n
ot been developed to meet Licensee's individual requirements, and that it is therefore Licensee
's responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in t
he Documentation meet such requirements. The Software and Documentation are only supplied for L
icensee's domestic and private use. Licensee agrees not to use the Software and Documentation f
or any commercial, business or
re-sale purposes, and Foundry has no liability to Licensee for any loss of profit, loss of busi
ness, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity. Foundry is only responsible for l
oss or damage suffered by Licensee that is a foreseeable result of Foundry's breach of the Agre
ement or its negligence but Foundry is not responsible for any loss or damage that is not fores
eeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if they were an obvious consequence of a breach or if the
y were contemplated by Licensee and
Foundry at the time of forming the Agreement. Our maximum aggregate liability under or in conne
ction with the Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, shall
in all circumstances be limited to a sum equal to the greater of US$5,000 (five thousand USD) a
nd a sum equal to the License Fee. Nothing in the Agreement shall limit or exclude Foundry's li
ability for death or personal injury resulting from our negligence, for fraud or fraudulent mis
representation or for any other
liability that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.

16. TERM; TERMINATION

16.1 The Agreement is effective upon Licensee's download of the Software, and the Agreement wil
l remain in effect until termination or expiry. Licensee may terminate the Agreement on written
 notice to Foundry if Foundry is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure the bre
ach within 10 (ten) working days of receiving notice of such breach. If Licensee breaches the A
greement, Foundry may terminate the License immediately by notice to Licensee.

16.2  If the Agreement expires or is terminated, the License will cease immediately and License
e will immediately cease use of any Software and Documentation and either return to Foundry all
 copies of the Software and Documentation in Licensee's possession, custody or power or, if Fou
ndry directs in writing, destroy all such copies. In the latter case, if requested by Foundry,
Licensee shall provide Foundry with a certificate confirming that such destruction has been com
pleted.

16.3 Foundry reserves the right to terminate and/or suspend the License as it deems reasonable
in its sole discretion by notice to Licensee if it becomes aware that Licensee has failed to pa
y any sum due either to Foundry or to a reseller of Foundry either in connection with the Agree
ment or in connection with any other Software license to use any product(s) of Foundry, in conn
ection with any Maintenance and Support Agreement or if the Licensee is otherwise in breach of
or fails to comply with any term of
the Agreement.

16.4 Foundry may also terminate this EULA if Licensee becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings
, becomes insolvent, or makes an arrangement with Licensee's creditors. This EULA will terminat
e automatically without further notice or action by Foundry if Licensee goes into liquidation.

17. CONFIDENTIALITY

Licensee agrees that the Software (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Source Code that
is licensed to Licensee) and Documentation are proprietary to and the confidential information
of Foundry or, as the case may be, the Third Party Licensors, and that all such information and
 any related communications (collectively, "Confidential Information") are confidential and a f
undamental and important trade secret of Foundry and/or the Third Party Licensors. If Licensee
is a business user, Licensee shall
disclose Confidential Information only to Licensee's employees who are working on an Authorized
 Project and have a "need-to-know" such Confidential Information for the purposes of that Autho
rized Project, and shall advise any recipients of Confidential Information that it is to be use
d only as expressly authorized in the Agreement. Licensee shall not disclose Confidential Infor
mation or otherwise make any Confidential Information available to any other of Licensee's empl
oyees or to any third parties
without the express written consent of Foundry. Licensee agrees to segregate, to the extent it
can be reasonably done, the Confidential Information from the confidential information and mate
rials of others in order to prevent commingling. Licensee shall take reasonable security measur
es, which measures shall be at least as great as the measures Licensee uses to keep Licensee's
own confidential information secure (but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of
care), to hold the Software,
Documentation and any other Confidential Information in strict confidence and safe custody. Fou
ndry may request, in which case Licensee agrees to comply with, certain reasonable security mea
sures as part of the use of the Software and Documentation. This clause shall not apply to any
information that is in or comes into the public domain (other than as a result of the Licensee'
s breach of its obligations under the Agreement), or was in Licensee's lawful possession before
 receipt or which Licensee develops
independently and without breach of this clause. Licensee acknowledges that monetary damages ma
y not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information, and that
Foundry shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or
other equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.

18. INSPECTION AND INFORMATION

18.1 Unless Licensee is a consumer, Licensee shall advise Foundry on demand of all locations wh
ere the Software or Documentation is used or stored. Licensee shall permit Foundry or its autho
rized agents to audit all such locations during normal business hours and on reasonable advance
 notice.

18.2 The Software may include mechanisms to access and collect limited information from compute
r(s) on which it is installed and from any IT systems to which those computer(s) may be connect
ed (including any system registry files) and transmit it to Foundry and/or its resellers, inclu
ding the ability to locally cache such information on such computers. Such information (the "In
formation") may include details of relevant license(s) to Foundry products, details of computer
 and network equipment, details of
the operating system(s) in use on such computer equipment, email domain relating to owners of s
uch computer and network equipment, the location of the computer(s) on which the Software is in
stalled and the profile and extent of use of the different elements of the Software and other F
oundry software. Foundry may use the Information to (a) model the profiles of usage, hardware a
nd operating systems in use collectively across its customer base in order to focus development
 and support, (b) to provide
targeted support to individual customers, (c) to ensure that the usage of the Software by Licen
see is in accordance with the Agreement and does not exceed any user number or other limits on
its use, (d) to confirm the identity of Licensee, to identify unlicensed use of the Software (i
ncluding use of pirated or other unlicensed copies of the Software) and to assist Foundry (and
its resellers and any enforcement bodies) in contacting any unlicensed users of the Software an
d seeking to terminate unlicensed
use of the Software, and (e) to advise Licensee about service issues such as available upgrades
 and maintenance expiry dates. To the extent that any Information constitutes personal data for
 the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") it shall be proc
essed in accordance with the GDPR and with Foundry's Privacy Notice (see https://www.foundry.co
m/privacy-notice), as may be updated by Foundry from time to time.  Licensee undertakes to make
 all of users of the Software aware
of the uses which Foundry will make of the Information and of the terms of Foundry's Privacy Po
licy.

18.3 By downloading or using the Software, you (i) warrant that you are entitled to control acc
ess to the computer(s) on which the Software is downloaded and any IT systems to which they may
 be connected, and (ii) irrevocably authorise Foundry (through the use of the Software) to acce
ss such computer(s) and IT systems (including any system registry files) and collect the Inform
ation from them and to transmit that Information to Foundry and its resellers (and any enforcem
ent bodies) and use it for the
purposes identified at clause 18.2(a) to (e) above.

19. U.S. GOVERNMENT LICENSE RIGHTS

All Software, including all components thereof, and Documentation qualify as "commercial items,
" as that term is defined at Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR") (48 C.F.R.) 2.101, consisti
ng of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such t
erms are used in FAR 12.212. Consistent with FAR 12.212 and DoD FAR Supp. 227.7202-1 through 22
7.7202-4, and notwithstanding any other FAR or other contractual clause to the contrary in any
agreement into which this Agreement
may be incorporated, a government end user will acquire the Software and Documentation with onl
y those rights set forth in this Agreement. Use of either the Software or Documentation or both
 constitutes agreement by the government that all Software and Documentation are "commercial co
mputer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," and constitutes acceptance o
f the rights and restrictions herein. The Software is the subject of the following notices:

 * Copyright (c) 2001 - 2020 The Foundry Visionmongers Ltd. All Rights Reserved. * Unpublished-

ed from time to time, and neither Foundry nor Licensee shall be required under the Agreement to
 act or fail to act in any way which it believes in good faith will violate any such laws or re
gulations. Without limiting the
foregoing, Licensee agrees that it will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, Foundr
y's Software or related products and services, or any commodity, technology, technical data, so
ftware or service that incorporates, contains or is a direct product of Foundry's Software, pro
ducts and/or services, (i) in violation of the Export Laws; (ii) to any country for which an ex

taining all necessary export

22.  MISCELLANEOUS

Unless Licensee is a consumer, the Agreement is the exclusive agreement between the parties con
cerning its subject matter and supersedes any and all prior oral or written agreements, negotia
tions, or other dealings between the parties concerning such subject matter. Licensee acknowled

 the Agreement inducing it to enter into the Agreement.

The Agreement may be modified only in writing, by Foundry, at any time.

The failure of either party to enforce any rights granted under the Agreement or to take action
 against the other party in the event of any such breach shall not be deemed a waiver by that p
arty as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breach
es.

atter or formation (including, unless Licensee is a consumer, non-contractual disputes or claim

ly submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts, subject to any right that a
consumer may have to bring proceedings or to have proceedings brought against them in a differe

 in doing so, that will not mean that Foundry has waived its rights.

29LT DESKTOP LICENSE

Desktop fonts are delivered to you in the OTF format. You may install and use the fonts on the number of computers specified in the purchased license.

Please read this document carefully and we recommend that you print a copy for further reference.

The terms of this End User License Agreement (EULA) will apply between 29Letters (29LT) and you if you purchase a license or licenses to use 29LT font software, including the design of the font embodied therein (Font).

You have purchased a license to use the Font in your scope of work. The license does NOT grant you ownership of the fonts. You agree that 29Letters owns all rights, including (without limitation) intellectual property rights, and title in and to the Font and all trademarks, registered and unregistered which are used in or in relation to the Font. It is NOT an agreement for sale of the Font or any portion of it.

The license granted is not exclusive to you and may not be transferred by you.

By downloading the Font, installing, copying, accessing, or otherwise using the Font you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement do not purchase this License, download, install, access, or use the Font.

LICENSE

Subject to payment of the price in full, 29Letters grants you a limited, non-exclusive, perpetual, license to use the Font you have licensed to create images on any surface such as computer screens, paper, printed material and other surfaces where the image is a fixed size.

You may install and use the Font up to the specified number of computers licensed under this Agreement indicated on your invoice, or install the Font on a single file server accessed by the specific number of computers licensed under this Agreement.

You may make one (1) back-up copy of the Font for archival purposes only, and you agree to retain exclusive custody and control over any such copy.

You may take a digitized copy of the Font used for a particular document, or the Font embedded in an electronic document, to a commercial printer or service bureau for use by the printer or service bureau in printing the document. Afterward, the service bureau or printer must destroy the copies of the Font. You agree to use reasonable measures to protect the Font from access and use by unlicensed third-parties. It is preferable though to take only PDF files with the Font embedded within instead of the original design file that require the actual Font to print.

If your client will need copies of the Font, your client must also purchase a license based on the number of computers in their office/s.

The Font may not be used to create or distribute any electronic document in which the Font, or any part thereof, is embedded in a format that permits editing, alterations, enhancements, or modifications or extraction of the Font by the recipient. You hereby agree not to transmit any electronic document to any party that intends to “hack,” edit, alter, enhance, or otherwise modify or remove the Font.

You agree not to modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, alter, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Font, unless permitted by applicable law.

You agree not to rent, sell, transfer, lease, sublicense, give, lend, or further distribute the Font.

EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL 29LETTERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE FONT EVEN IF NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE OF SUCH POSSIBILITY. You hereby agree that your entire, exclusive, and cumulative liability and remedy shall be limited to the cost of the Font or replacement thereof, at 29Letters’s discretion.

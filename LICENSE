The initial commit to the Git repository was a copy of files from the Gist at

  https://gist.github.com/sixtenbe/1178136

which is licensed under the WTFPL (which is public domain equivalent). That
code in turn was based off a MATLAB function from

  http://billauer.co.il/peakdet.html

which was released to the public domain.

In the following refactoring commits the WTFPL license was removed from the
source files and not replaced with any other license:

* 6b6577e9c48a7bbdd7a5e225daad79f77527270f
* a91ecc31e46e9b2f82912e41f563c6064c5d0082
* f7a7d3d8d89795666d9c0ebbb969805789a799f5

The project listing on PyPI does not mention a license and neither does the
GitHub repository or the readme. The repository is archived so an issue
requesting clarification cannot be opened.

Please note that CodeLathe reserves the right to discontinue bug fixes and/or otherwise provide support for all versions—other than the most current version—of FileCloud.

FileCloud Relay Service : CodeLathe will offer relay infrastructure and services that enable you to create, open, edit and save Microsoft Office files stored in FileCloud using Microsoft Office 365.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by 
permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its 
copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, 
CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright 
and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution 
terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, 
that you must include source code if you redistribute 
it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.) 
However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any 
program generated from the IJG code, this does not 
limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do. 

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced 
with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software 
Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds 
for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, 
ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, 
install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely 
distributable. 

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the 
JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and 
Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be 
used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this 
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed 
from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding 
provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented 
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many 
implementations will support it.) So far as we are 
aware, there are no patent restrictions on the 
remaining code. 

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and 
write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys 
LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed 
altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to 
produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not 
use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are 
larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF 
decoders. 

We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange 
Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe 
Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of 
CompuServe Incorporated."

incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use
or inability to use the Work (including but not
limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any

form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain
such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner
on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License.
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant
the rights conveyed by this License.

Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent
or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and
to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and
not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity
or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the
license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must
make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license
steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
License from time to time. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by the license
steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You
may create and use a modified version of this License if You:
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of
the license steward (except to note that the license differs
from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE
IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging
that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software
where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and
all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by
You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding
licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO
LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as that
term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial
computer software documentation as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or
other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in
computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
(except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for
costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and
the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and
damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization
of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on
an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

patent license is
	  granted: 1) for code that You delete from the 
Original Code; 2)
	  separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for

Modifications made by
	  that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

 3.1. Application of License.
 The Modifications which You create or to which You 
contribute are
 governed by the terms of this License, including 
without limitation
 Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered 
Code may be
 distributed only under the terms of this License 
or a future version
 of this License released under Section 6.1, and 
You must include a
 copy of this License with every copy of the Source 
Code You
 distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms 
on any Source Code
 version that alters or restricts the applicable 
version of this
 License or the recipients' rights hereunder. 
However, You may include
 an additional document offering the additional 
rights described in
 Section 3.5.

 3.2. Availability of Source Code.
 Any Modification which You create or to which You 
contribute must be
 made available in Source Code form under the terms 
of this License
 either on the same media as an Executable version 
or via an accepted
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to 
whom you made an
 Executable version available; and if made 
available via Electronic
 Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for 
at least twelve (12)
 months after the date it initially became 
available, or at least six
 (6) months after a subsequent version of that 
particular Modification
 has been made available to such recipients. You 
are responsible for
 ensuring that the Source Code version remains 
available even if the
 Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by 
a third party.

 3.3. Description of Modifications.
 You must cause all Covered Code to which You 
contribute to contain a
 file documenting the changes You made to create 
that Covered Code and
 the date of any change. You must include a 
prominent statement that
 the Modification is derived, directly or 
indirectly, from Original
 Code provided by the Initial Developer and 
including the name of the
 Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) 
in any notice in an
 Executable version or related documentation in 
which You describe the
 origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

 3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
	  (a) Third Party Claims.
	  If Contributor has knowledge that a license 
under a third party's
	  intellectual property rights is required to 
exercise the rights
	  granted by such Contributor under Sections 
2.1 or 2.2,
	  Contributor must include a text file with the 
Source Code
	  distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes 
the claim and the
	  party making the claim in sufficient detail 
that a recipient will
	  know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains 
such knowledge after
	  the Modification is made available as 
described in Section 3.2,
	  Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL 
file in all copies
	  Contributor makes available thereafter and 
shall take other steps
	  (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists 
or newsgroups)
	  reasonably calculated to inform those who 
received the Covered
	  Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

	  (b) Contributor APIs.
	  If Contributor's Modifications include an 
application programming
	  interface and Contributor has knowledge of 
patent licenses which
	  are reasonably necessary to implement that 
API, Contributor must
	  also include this information in the LEGAL 
file.

		   (c)    Representations.
	  Contributor represents that, except as 
disclosed pursuant to
	  Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes 
that Contributor's
	  Modifications are Contributor's original 
creation(s) and/or
	  Contributor has sufficient rights to grant 
the rights conveyed by
	  this License.

 3.5. Required Notices.
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each 
file of the Source
 Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in 
a particular Source
 Code file due to its structure, then You must 
include such notice in a
 location (such as a relevant directory) where a 
user would be likely
 to look for such a notice.  If You created one or 
more Modification(s)
 You may add your name as a Contributor to the 
notice described in
 Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License 
in any documentation
 for the Source Code where You describe recipients' 
rights or ownership
 rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose 
to offer, and to
 charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability
 obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Code. However, You
 may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on 
behalf of the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You must make it 
absolutely clear than
 any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is
 offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to 
indemnify the Initial
 Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
incurred by the
 Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result 
of warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

 3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
 You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form 
only if the
 requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for 
that Covered Code,
 and if You include a notice stating that the 
Source Code version of
 the Covered Code is available under the terms of 
this License,
 including a description of how and where You have 
fulfilled the
 obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be 
conspicuously included
 in any notice in an Executable version, related 
documentation or
 collateral in which You describe recipients' 
rights relating to the
 Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable 
version of Covered
 Code or ownership rights under a license of Your 
choice, which may
 contain terms different from this License, 
provided that You are in
 compliance with the terms of this License and that 
the license for the
 Executable version does not attempt to limit or 
alter the recipient's
 rights in the Source Code version from the rights 
set forth in this
 License. If You distribute the Executable version 
under a different
 license You must make it absolutely clear that any 
terms which differ
 from this License are offered by You alone, not by 
the Initial
 Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to 
indemnify the
 Initial Developer and every Contributor for any 
liability incurred by
 the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a 
result of any such
 terms You offer.

 3.7. Larger Works.
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered 
Code with other code
 not governed by the terms of this License and 
distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must 
make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the 
Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of 
the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered 
Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You 
must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent 
possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. 
Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in 
Section 3.4 and must
 be included with all distributions of the Source 
Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such 
description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary 
skill to be able to
 understand it.

5. Application of this License.

 This License applies to code to which the Initial 
Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related 
Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

 6.1. New Versions.
 Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") 
may publish revised
 and/or new versions of the License from time to 
time. Each version
 will be given a distinguishing version number.

 6.2. Effect of New Versions.
 Once Covered Code has been published under a 
particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under 
the terms of that
 version. You may also choose to use such Covered 
Code under the terms
 of any subsequent version of the License published 
by Netscape. No one
 other than Netscape has the right to modify the 
terms applicable to
 Covered Code created under this License.

 6.3. Derivative Works.
 If You create or use a modified version of this 
License (which you may
 only do in order to apply it to code which is not 
already Covered Code
 governed by this License), You must (a) rename 
Your license so that
 the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", 
"Netscape",
 "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do 
not appear in your
 license (except to note that your license differs 
from this License)
 and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version 
of the license
 contains terms which differ from the Mozilla 
Public License and
 Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of 
the Initial
 Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the 
notice described in
 Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be 
modifications of
 this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

 COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN 
"AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED 
CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE 
OF THE COVERED CODE
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE 
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
 COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
 OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS 
LICENSE. NO USE OF
 ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT 
UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

 8.1.  This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms 
herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of 
the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly 
granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. 
Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License
 shall survive.

 8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a 
patent infringement
 claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) 
against Initial Developer
 or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or 
Contributor against whom
 You file such action is referred to as 
"Participant")  alleging that:

 (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version 
directly or indirectly
 infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such
 Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 
of this License
 shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant 
terminate prospectively,
 unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice 
You either: (i)
 agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually 
agreeable reasonable
 royalty for Your past and future use of 
Modifications made by such
 Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation 
claim with respect to
 the Contributor Version against such Participant.  
If within 60 days
 of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment 
arrangement are not
 mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or 
the litigation claim
 is not withdrawn, the rights granted by 
Participant to You under
 Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at 
the expiration of
 the 60 day notice period specified above.

 (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than 
such Participant's
 Contributor Version, directly or indirectly 
infringes any patent, then
 any rights granted to You by such Participant 
under Sections 2.1(b)
 and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date 
You first made, used,
 sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made 
by that
 Participant.

 8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim 
against Participant
 alleging that such Participant's Contributor 
Version directly or
 indirectly infringes any patent where such claim 
is resolved (such as
 by license or settlement) prior to the initiation 
of patent
 infringement litigation, then the reasonable value 
of the licenses
 granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 
2.2 shall be taken
 into account in determining the amount or value of 
any payment or
 license.

 8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 
8.1 or 8.2 above,
 all end user license agreements (excluding 
distributors and resellers)
 which have been validly granted by You or any 
distributor hereunder
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, 
WHETHER TORT
 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, 
SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY 
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE 
TO ANY PERSON FOR
 ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES 
FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR 
ANY AND ALL OTHER
 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY 
SHALL HAVE BEEN
 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS 
LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH 
OR PERSONAL INJURY
 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE 
EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO 
NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
 THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

 The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that 
term is defined in
 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
"commercial computer
 software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation," as such
 terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). 
Consistent with 48
 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4 (June 1995),
 all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code 
with only those
 rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

 This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is 
held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed 
only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. This License 
shall be governed by
 California law provisions (except to the extent 
applicable law, if
 any, provides otherwise), excluding its 
conflict-of-law provisions.
 With respect to disputes in which at least one 
party is a citizen of,
 or an entity chartered or registered to do 
business in the United
 States of America, any litigation relating to this 
License shall be
 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts 
of the Northern
 District of California, with venue lying in Santa 
Clara County,
 California, with the losing party responsible for 
costs, including
 without limitation, court costs and reasonable 
attorneys' fees and
 expenses. The application of the United Nations 
Convention on
 Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
expressly excluded.
 Any law or regulation which provides that the 
language of a contract
 shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this
 License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

 As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, 
each party is
 responsible for claims and damages arising, 
directly or indirectly,
 out of its utilization of rights under this 
License and You agree to
 work with Initial Developer and Contributors to 
distribute such
 responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing 
herein is intended or
 shall be deemed to constitute any admission of 
liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

 Initial Developer may designate portions of the 
Covered Code as
 "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means 
that the Initial
 Developer permits you to utilize portions of the 
Covered Code under
 Your choice of the NPL or the alternative 
licenses, if any, specified
 by the Initial Developer in the file described in 
Exhibit A.

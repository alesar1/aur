We as SubGenius arteests really busted our asses on these, and YET we allow you to use them FREE OF CHARGE... for 15 days!! EXACTLY 15 days, and not one hour longer. If, at the end of that time, you enjoy using these "dingbats" and would like to keep them in your computer, PAY YOUR SHAREWARE FEE -- or your computer, and the building in which it is housed, will explode automatically. SERIOUSLY! The Church needs every penny it can get, and surely you need a much cleaner conscience than the one you currently use. WHY NOT??

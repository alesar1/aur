## creeptifica

[creeptifica](https://github.com/Akuma/creeptifica) is an adaptation of the amazingly simplistic yet stunning [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep) & [scientifica](https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica).
Like the two formerly mentioned projects, most characters are only 4px wide, which greatly accommodates low dpi displays.

# datadog-puppy

This package is the [DataDog agent](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent) in "puppy" mode; it doesn't have built-in python, but uses significantly less memory (~21M resident vs ~98M resident, on my machines).

Note that it requires a significant amount of space to build; 5G should be safe.

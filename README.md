## Changelog

Initial release (11/27/2016)

## AUR (Arch User Repository) Package
Run `pacman -S universal-ifr-extractor-linux-git` as the root user.

Link: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/universal-ifr-extractor-linux-git/

## Build Instructions

Install the `cmake` (version 2.8+) and `clang` packages on Linux.

Run these commands in a shell/terminal:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/TGSoftware/Universal-IFR-Extractor.git
cd Universal-IFR-Extractor
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will produce an executable called `ifrextract`.  It has no external files or dependencies, so feel free to copy it to your `/usr/local/bin` $PATH directory or simply run it in the directory it was built in (`./ifrextract`).

## Usage

From the location of the built binary:

``` sh
./ifrextract input_file # Will check the file type and output UEFI, EFI, or UNKNOWN

./ifrextract input_file output_file # Will proceed with generating a human readable extraction.
```

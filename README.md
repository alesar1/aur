# OverGrive

This package provides an easy way to install OverGrive in arch+based distributions.

The OverGrive site already provides a ```tar.xz``` package, but this package is not in the AUR and requires many steps before and after the package installation through ```pacman```.

This package uses the one obtained from the OverGrive site as base, and executes the necessary steps to make it work without any extra steps.

___

Use ```sh build.sh``` to test the build and generate the ```.SRCINFO```

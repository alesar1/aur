# Daggerfall Unity Arch Packaging Tools
This repository contains tools for adding an PKGBUILD to the AUR for the remake of The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall in Unity.

For ease of use and installation the tools do not build from source. Instead it downloads prebuilt versions that are available from the developers website. This is because the source code requires a full Unity install to build and the Daggerfall Sourcecode is not freely available.

The Daggerfall Unity Project Source Code is available at https://github.com/Interkarma/daggerfall-unity.

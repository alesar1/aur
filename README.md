# AMDGPU DKMS

This repository contains Arch Linux `PKGBUILD` and patches to make AMDGPU DKMS 19.30 builds on Linux 5.1 and 5.2. You should not really use this unless you're using Navi cards (e.g. Radeon RX 5700).

This package only provides the DKMS, you will need OpenGL and other libraries, e.g. [amdgpu-pro](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=n&K=amdgpu-pro&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go) packages.

# google-chat-linux-git

aur package for this upstream project : https://github.com/squalou/google-chat-linux

I'm not the author of the app : praise **robyf** for his excellent work.

I forked it, and now apckage it for AUR.

This package includes electron runtime (5.0.0-beta6). This may change when beta version is no more required. (long story short : google chat web client inside electron 'search' function requires a recent version on chromium)

# Celery workers handle background tasks (such file imports or federation
# messaging). The more processes a worker gets, the more tasks
# can be processed in parallel. However, more processes also means
# a bigger memory footprint.
# By default, a worker will span a number of process equal to your number
# of CPUs. You can adjust this, by explicitly setting the --concurrency
# flag:
#   celery -A funkwhale_api.taskapp worker -l INFO --concurrency=4

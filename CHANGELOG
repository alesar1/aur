# New and Improved Features

- This release features new layout algorithms for the class diagram (#375). The algorithms leverage a number of heuristics to keep diagram clears by avoiding overlap and edge crossings, while selecting intuitive-looking paths and more effective label placement (#446).
- In sequence diagrams, we no longer delete the implicit parameter when a constructor call is deleted (#437);

# Bug Fixes

- Cannot select overlapped implicit parameters in sequence diagram (#438);
- Drag package content to bottom of viewport. Subsequence dragging misbehaves (#445)
- Code Refactorings
- Refactor the PersistenceTests (#439)
- Update Checkstyle style file to 8.44 (#440)
- Code Modernization and Cleanup (#456). JetUML now runs on Java 17.

v2.4
====
Add a picture-wide menu with actions such as "Replace withâ€¦", thus missing
pictures can be replaces without the necessity to set the durations again, or
"View file" to open the file in the system image viewer.

Wallpaper types are now managed from the primary menu again.

v2.3
====
Add the ability to search among pictures, fix a memory leak, improve the
automatic duration setting, make the window easier to resize, and update
translations.

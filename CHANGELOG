## v0.27.0 (Aug 16, 2021)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* All command execution calls are now made (on *nix systems) using a shell command call ('/bin/sh -c ...') with [process group](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpgid.2.html) set to ensure all signals are propagated to the called commands. This was done to eliminate the need for parsing the shell command as it was a continual source of bugs. Windows systems currently only support single command calls because of no (known) 'sh -c' equivalent on Windows.

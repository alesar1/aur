v2.5
====

The images can now be easily sorted according to their filename.

This update also removes obsolete or unreliable features like "find and replace",
or the possibility to set a file as lockscreen (which was not possible with most
environments, and is not even possible GDM since the version 3.36).

Minor bugs have been fixed too, like the weird behavior when closing the "find"
entry, or actions that were disabled when they shouldn't.

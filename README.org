#+TITLE: ArXiv-open

A small script to open arXiv links of the form ~arxiv:xyz~ and ~arXiv:xyz~ by
opening the appropriate page in the browser.  The desktop entry introduces the
appropriate ~x-scheme-handler~ so that arXiv links can be handled system wide.

Although not standard, it also supports links of the form ~arxiv://xyz~ and
~arXiv://xyz~.

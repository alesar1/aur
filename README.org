#+TITLE: Sailfish SDK on Arch Linux
#+LANGUAGE: english

* Intro
  This package is a port of the Sailfish SDK utilities to be run on Arch Linux.
  The use of these programs on Arch Linux is completely unsupported, so if you have issues report them here.
  The idea behind is to be able to develop programs for Sailfish OS without using the SDK.

* Scope
  This package only packages all programs that make sense to use on Arch Linux in the scope of this package.

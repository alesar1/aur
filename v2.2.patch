 # NOTE TO PACKAGERS: The embedded git commit hash is critical for rapid bug triage when the builds
 # can come from a variety of sources. If you are mirroring the sources or otherwise build when
 # the .git directory is not present, please comment the following line:
-include(GetGitCommitHash)
+#include(GetGitCommitHash)
 # and instead uncomment the following, adding the complete git hash of the checkout you are using:
-# set(GIT_COMMIT_HASH 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
+set(GIT_COMMIT_HASH c4ad073d1b3d3fcd81b34cbe5f2352547b14213f)

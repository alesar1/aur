Make sure to write this line to your custom stylesheet:

    html, atom-workspace {background-color: transparent;}

Because Atom has preset background-colors on elements.
You may need to reset more elements' background according to
specific UI theme you are using.

If you use tia-ui theme then just that line is enough.

To run directly with /usr/bin/atom-beta, use like this:

    atom-beta --enable-transparent-visuals --disable-gpu

append more option as you like.

.SH SYNOPSIS

faur fetch [\f[I]pkgs\f[]]\&...
.PP
faur update
.PP
faur help
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
faur downloads packages to the directory specified in $AURDIR.
If $AURDIR is unset $HOME/aur is used as a default.
Packages are cloned from the git repository located under $AUR_PATH, if
unset https://aur.archlinux.org/ is used as a default value.
.PP
The update command checks to see which if any of the packages underneath
$AURDIR need to be updated and notifies the user.
.SH DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT
.PP
faur \f[I]does not\f[] attempt to resolve dependencies, as doing so
would discourage the user from reading PKGBUILD files before
installation.
.PP
Users should bear in mind that the AUR is an \f[I]untrusted\f[] source
of packages and always exercise caution when installing packages from
it.

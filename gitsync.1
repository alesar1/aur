gitsync
.SH SYNOPSIS
gitsync is a repository-syncronisation daemon, whose purpose is to keep coders on the same project aware of each others' work without requiring any pushes to remotes. Running on machines on the same local network, on any given peer it will auto-fetch any branches modified on the other peers.
.PP
For example, say Alice and Bob are working on repo 'foo' on their separate machines. With gitsyncd running on both machines, everytime Alice makes a local commit, Bob's machine will auto-fetch Alice's modified branch into a local one named `gitsync-Alice-<branch>`.
.PP
.SH RUNNING
Run with `gitsyncd /path/to/repo`.
.TP
You can open up a local webserver to see a live-updating page of your coworkers' changes by supplying a port number: 
.TP
.B
\fbgitsyncd \fB-webport\fP=<port> /path/to/repo
.TP
Then go to `http://localhost:<port>` (it's very rudimentary for now).
.TP
See extended options by running `gitsyncd \fB-h\fP`.

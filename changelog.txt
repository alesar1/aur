* Thu Dec 16 2021 Vladimir Svyatski <vsvyatski@yandex.ru> - 8.4.0-1
  PeaZip 8.4.0 is the first release providing experimental native packages for Darwin/macOS
  platform, built for aarch64 M1 Apple Silicon SoC, and Intel x86_64.
  This release brings fixes, improvements in management of temporary files, option to stop
  test batches only if errors are detected, and new language selection control.
  A new alternative benchmark is available, based on integer and floating point arithmetic,
  testing single core and multi core performances.
  PeaZip now comes with updated backends: Pea 1.05, and 7z 21.06, which are now employed on
  all platforms.
  On Linux, 7z backend replaces p7zip, which is still fully supported as alternative.
  New peazip-x.y.z.pack package is meant to help developers to create packages of PeaZip
  for various package management systems (e.g. DEB, RPM), containing packages' directories
  from last build.
  It does not replaces or duplicates the function of sources package peazip-x.y.z.src, as
  it is simply meant to help packaging the application for a specific distribution system,
  rather than compiling and building the binaries of the application.

  command line usage, management of preferred checksum/hash algorithms list and
  management of temporary work files.
  The release is focused on improving the support for Linux, and to make easier to
  port or package the application in environments, mandating a precise filesystem
  hierarchy structure, separating architecture-dependent binary resources from other
  types of resources, packaged with the application.

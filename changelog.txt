  PeaZip 8.3.0 adds Deflate and Deflate64 options for .7z format, improves theming,
  command line usage, management of preferred checksum/hash algorithms list and
  management of temporary work files.
  The release is focused on improving the support for Linux, and to make easier to
  port or package the application in environments, mandating a precise filesystem
  hierarchy structure, separating architecture-dependent binary resources from other
  types of resources, packaged with the application.
  Full list of changes and fixes is available at https://peazip.github.io/changelog.html

* Tue Sep 14 2021 Edoardo Brogiolo <edoardo@brogiolo.eu> - 8.2.0-3
  PeaZip 8.2.0 is focused on improving the use from command line and scripts, and
  introduces the (peazip)/res/batch folder, which contains sample scripts and system
  integration files for both Linux and Windows (the SendTo and freedesktop_integration
  folders are moved there).
  The archive manager is now capable of optionally displaying compression/encryption
  method and modified, created, accessed timestamps for each item in the archive, and
  displaying the number of items, contained in each folder.
  It is now possible to choose to keep extracted files even in the case errors occurred
  during the extraction; working with spanned files was improved.
  "Smart extraction" is now available as a default action to take at program's startup,
  alongside "Open", "Open as archive", "Extract (full)", "Extract here".
  This release also improves the user experience on Linux systems by improving the
  automatic configuration of applications for the "open with" actions and by displaying
  more system paths in the file manager.
  The application is now installed in /opt/peazip.
  The backend was updated to Brotli 1.0.9 (Linux).
  A total of 225 file extensions can now be managed by PeaZip, with addition of .apkm,
  .apks and .aab Android package formats, and of Lzip .lz (supported on Linux versions
  only).

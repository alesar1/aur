To complete the installation of userchromeJS, you need to copy the directory:

  /usr/share/firefox-userchromejs/chrome

into your firefox profile directory, which should be located at:

  ~/.mozilla/firefox/<some-chars>.<profile-name>

(including the 'chrome' directory itself). Then you can copy additional .uc.js
and .as.css files to be loaded into the 'chrome' folder. See more detailed
instructions, as well as some scripts and themes to chose from, see:

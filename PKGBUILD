    # Gem dependencies can be installed per user and not systemwide in

    # Gem dependencies can be installed as an Arch Linux package which is
    # created by tools like gem2arch or pacgem. However, what will happen if
    # package wearing the same name as those installed by these tools appear in
    # the Arch repos? As conflict checks are not performed by these tools, we
    # highly risk package names clashes. -> Too dangerous.

    # Gem dependencies can also be installed in the directory we specify, but
    # the latter will be removed after we have build the book. The PKGBUILD
    # will have to redownload again all these deps if the user wants to update
    # hos book.

# Note: These TODO may not be things I'm planning to fix. Some of them are just
# notes to be fixed by someone else who wants that functionality and warnings
# to those who are expecting that functionality. The HylaFAX+ and AvantFAX
# PKGBUILD have taken many days to get them functional on a modern OS.
# I can't spend a lot more time fixing things I don't use without help.

# TODO: Check Arch Linux in TARGET="...unknown..."
# TODO: More systemd boot support (faxmodem).
# TODO: SendEmail/smtp-cli.pl support instead of sendmail/postfix

# WANT: Enabled Feature List: client, server, send fax, answer fax, answer modem, answer voice
# WANT: CLI fax manager (avantfax?)
# WANT: faxstat how to show only the last n days, like tail?
# WANT: a faxmovemodem: to rename or remove modem without shutting fax system down, compatible with faxmodem and faxgetty.

# TODO: Automatically fix font path in /usr/lib/fax/hyla.conf whenever ghostscript upgrades.
# TODO: Cover pages in PKGBUILD for ready made installs.
# TODO: faxcron timer run as uucp. faxqclean must run as root.
# TODO: find more optional dependencies

# Setup these parameters

_opt_AreaCode="517"
_opt_FAXNumber="+1.517.555.0001"    # Default: +1.517.555.0001
_opt_LocalIdentifier="ArchLinuxFAX" # Default: ArchLinuxFAX
_opt_RingsBeforeAnswer="1"  # set to 0 to make faxgetty send only
_opt_MaintenanceTime="06:10:00"  # Cleanup will run every 12 hours starting at this time

# How to install:
# Recommended build command: makepkg -scCfi

# Before running faxsetup, let's see which daemons we want to run.
# man faxq # used only if modems are present on this system
# man hfaxd # also read the part about SNPP
# Enable the ones you want. faxsetup will start them.
# systemctl enable faxq
# systemctl enable hfaxd

# sudo faxsetup

# faxsetup will ask to run faxaddmodem only if there are no modems set up. 
# Answer yes if you like but you might as well answer no to
#   Do you want to run faxaddmodem to configure a modem [yes]? no
# because you'll need to run faxaddmodem anyways to add more modems.

# You can run with or without faxgetty
# faxgetty makes your setup more reliable and easier to manage.
# faxgetty is suitable for send/receive or send only environments.
# faxgetty is not required. If using faxgetty answer "NO" to
#   Should I run faxmodem for each configured modem [yes]? no
# and enable/start your modems.
# faxmodem systemd support is incomplete. Modems will not autostart on boot.

# sudo faxaddmodem
# Add as many modems as you like. See below for some untested high speed techniques.

# Enable one of the modems with some of the following commands.

# sudo systemctl enable faxgetty@ttyUSB0.service
# sudo systemctl start faxgetty@ttyUSB0.service
# sudo systemctl enable faxgetty@ttyACM0.service
# sudo systemctl start faxgetty@ttyACM0.service

# You only need to enable the first faxgetty service manually. faxsetup will 
# detect that faxgetty is in use and automatically enable and start all 
# configured modems. When all modems are added run faxsetup again to restart 
# the servers and enable all modems.

# sudo faxsetup

# HylaFAX recommends you run faxsetup to restart the servers after every 
# upgrade. This PKGBUILD is programmed to not require this. You need to run 
# faxsetup whenever ghostscript upgrades or the fonts won't be found. This 
# needs to be fixed if anyone can figure out how.

# Are the services running?
# systemctl status faxq
# systemctl status hfaxd
# systemctl list-units "faxgetty@*.service"
# systemctl list-timers

# Once you have a modem set up with phone line unplugged
# sendfax -n -d 5175551212 /etc/passwd
# Once you see that the modem is trying to send, let's see the job.
# faxstat -s
# Let's delete that job (change the id as necessary)
# faxrm 1
# Be patient. This can take a minute if the job is active on a modem in faxq.
# Let's see what happened to that job.
# faxstat -sd
# After you get a few real faxes sent, let's see how we're performing.
# xferfaxstats
# Let's see a log file
# less /var/spool/hylafax/etc/xferfaxlog

# Avoid restarting the daemons manually with systemctl. Too many commands, and 
# too tricky. Use faxsetup to restart the daemons and enable the modems.

# If the skel defaults are correct and prefab modem configs are available a 
# large number of modems could be automatically set up this way.
# cd /dev; for i in ttyUSB[1-3]; do faxaddmodem -nointeractive -s 38400 $i; done

# Once the first one is set up, a fast, loose, and untested method for a very 
# large number of identical modems could work like this:
# cd /dev
# mdmlist=`echo ttyUSB* ttyS* ttya[a-m]*` # example 8 USB, 4 serial, 13*16=832 Digi PortServer (dgrp).
# # This is ridiculous of course since there's no single computer with enough 
# # power to run 844 fax modems.
# cd /var/spool/hylafax
# for ttymdm in $mdmlist; do
#   if [ "$ttymdm" != "ttyUSB0" ]; then
#     cp -p /etc/config.ttyUSB0 /etc/config.$ttymdm
#     mkfifo FIFO.$ttymdm
#     # faxmodem $ttymdm
#     systemctl enable faxgetty@$ttymodem.service
#     systemctl start faxgetty@$ttymodem.service
#   fi
# done

# Linux modem support is troublesome. Serial based products all create ttys
# which requires them to be kernel modules. Linux changes the kernel interface 
# constantly for peak functionality and performance. This means that many 
# modem products work for a while then quit working as of a certain kernel 
# version. Manufacturers much prefer Windows where driver compatibility is 
# maintained over many versions rather than going back to revise the driver 
# each time the Linux kernel devs change something. Arch Linux as a rolling 
# release is on the front lines of this constant change. Modems are a 
# declining market so manufacturers have little interest in continuously 
# revising drivers. The solution for us is to stick to interfaces that are 
# actively maintained either by the manufacturers or by the Linux kernel devs.

# Here are the ones that continue to work even on the latest kernels. I'm only
# listing brands with 2 or more ports and modems I've tried. Multi port serial 
# products is sorted by number of lights. I'm only listing products similar
# to those I've tried. There may be other well supported products.

# Ethernet serial: Digi PortServer dgrp
# Note: Some fax documentation recommend against Ethernet serial servers
# because of the unpredictable delays inherent in Ethernet communication.
# I don't see any other way to support hundreds of modems.

#  (This modem is properly supported by usbserial & udev in Linux 4.0+. You 
#   don't need the mknod instructions found at the Multitech web site.)

# I prefer USB over PCI, PCIe, or Ethernet. Ethernet has timing issues.
# No reason to compete for a limited number of high performance PCIe slots 
# with low performance serial devices. ISA, EISA, VESA, PCI, PCIe are all 
# temporary technologies that will be replaced eventually. USB will last
# essentially forever with no changes.

# The HylaFAX binaries work very well. The scripts need major fixes!
# HylaFAX+ is pretty much completely broken for any Linux install,

# [x] Slackbuild tgz: Slackware
# [x] Pacman PKGBUILD: Arch Linux

# These have a few well chosen ./configure options but no substantial sed hacks

  # Var $TTY clashes with the Arch Linux environment and likely all other Linux 
  # too. $TTY contains the terminal device from `tty`. With this already set 
  # to a known valid terminal, faxaddmodem never asks for a modem device and 
  # immedately tests the terminal for a modem. We haven't used modems for 
  # terminals for a long time and even when we did, you can't test a modem 
  # while it's "off hook" actively running a terminal. This bug blocks the 
  # to add modems interactively by running faxaddmodem or faxsetup leaving
  # big hole of complexity in setting up HylaFAX+.
  # Until we fix this, automatic modem setup in faxsetup must be skipped.
  # Modems can only be added with "faxaddmodem ttyUSB0". Then you need to run
  # faxsetup again to start all the modems.

  # We change TTY -> MDMTTY instead of -> TTYMDM to prevent sed recursive replace.

  # "faxaddmodem /dev/ttyUSB0" adds the device as "config._dev_ttyUSB0". This 
  # would be clever if the scripts could handle this, but they can't. We'll trim 
  # /dev/ off so the scripts work. It is too much to ask installing admins to 
  # remember to leave /dev/ off when no screens specify such. If the device 
  # is outside of /dev/ then we leave the folder intact resulting in a device
  # like "config._proc_stuff". I'm certain this won't work but 
  # until someone finds a use for a device outside of /dev 
  # this set of bugs will stay the way they are.
  # Fix bugs in /dev/tty* handling. Make faxaddmodem /dev/ttyUSB0 behave the 
  # same as faxaddmodem ttyUSB0. 
  # With all these bugs fixed you can install HylaFAX+ the way it was

  # This fixes many problems and enables a lot of functionality.
  # * The Arch Linux Pacman file backup technique isn't friendly to reinstalls.
  # * Whether and what user changes can be easily found with any diff tool.
  # * You can start over with a new copy preserving only the crufty
  #   user mods you still want.
  # * Related installers can add their own foo.superbar.default files without
  #   calously overwriting user mods preventing the problem where
  #   "Installing superbar will fubar your server" and the apps can be installed
  #   in any order. Diff can be used to determine which variant is in use 
  #   and more diff can be used to switch user mods from one variant to another.
  # * Installers can automatically remove or upgrade unchanged files.
  # * Users are encouraged to make their own defaults like foo.central.default
  #   complete with their own installers.
  # * Eventually this leads to the proper use where the master script sources
  #   bunches of addons to obtain the desired result.
  # * When you see a .default file you know the related file is supposed to be 
  #   modifed.

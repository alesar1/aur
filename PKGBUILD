# Maintainer:
# Note I abandoned trying to get this working because the project doesn't even
# have a download URL that is sanely parsable and installing WAR files that
# need 1Gig free space for a user password reset tool seemed a bit out of
# hand to me.
# After 3 years worth of trying to get a sane package together and multiple
# requests for the upstream to tag versions or do anything to make external
# builds easier and having all the issues closed because it's not something
# they are interested in encouraging (likely because they are trying to push
# people to use their hosted version instead of the OSS project), I am finally
# out. I have no interest in figting for something I no longer have an interest
# in using.

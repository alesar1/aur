  # however, I needed to update most of them in order to update to 5.6.0 and to use the latest ANGLE

  # The ICU libraries used for cross-compilation are named exactly the same as their native Linux counterpart
  patch -p1 -b -i ../qt5-qtwebkit-use-correct-icu-libs.patch

  # By default the build system assumes that pkg-config isn't used for the win32 target
  # However, we're using it in the Fedora MinGW toolchain so make sure it is used automatically

  # qt5-webkit depends on qt5-base with ICU support.
  # As ICU support in qtbase also introduces over 20MB of additional dependency
  # bloat (and the qtbase libraries itself are only 13MB) the decision was made
  # to build qtbase without ICU support.
  # Make sure qtwebkit doesn't depend on a qtbase with ICU support any more
  patch -p1 -b -i ../qt5-qtwebkit-dont-depend-on-icu.patch

  # Undo the removal of the old Qt4 based unicode support
  # as we want to use it instead of the bloated ICU

  # WebKit svn commit 136242 implemented a split into QtWebKit and QtWebKitWidgets
  # Due to this change a static library named WebKit1.a is created first.
  # After this a shared library is created named Qt5WebKit.dll which contains
  # the contents of this static library and some other object files.
  # However, various symbols in the static library are expected to be exported
  # in the Qt5WebKit.dll shared library. As static libraries normally don't care
  # about exported symbols (everything is exported after all) the decoration
  # attribute Q_DECL_EXPORT won't be set.
  # This results in undefined references when trying to link the QtWebKitWidgets
  # shared library (which depends on various symbols which aren't exported properly
  # in the Qt5WebKit.dll shared library)

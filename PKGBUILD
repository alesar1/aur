# This is the package build for the tools to build nban and the shuriken
# This was originally developed for Ninja OS, but has been back ported to Arch
# Linux.

# Lets be very clear in what "Boot'n'Nuke" means. It means it scrubs all data
# from all attached storage media upon boot. This is a security tool meant to
# end of life computers so they can be disposed of without the fear of data
# retrieval by an attacker. Unlike "Darik's Boot'n'Nuke", which is somewhat
# complex, Ninja Boot'n'Nuke is very simple with no options. It is based on
# Arch Linux, and follows the Arch Way. Simple, written in shell code, and
# re-uses existing Arch Linux features.

# Further more, this package can also create "shurikens", or a single use nban
# on a stick with extlinux bootloader. The tool allows for custom kernels, and
# in the future, isolinux and pxelinux, so that the user can make a custom
# shuriken for any hardware.(see shuriken_forge --help)

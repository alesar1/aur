# This is Jonathan Wilkes' nw.js variant of Pd-L2Ork nick-named "Purr-Data".
# Basically, it is Pd-L2Ork with the Tk GUI replaced with a JavaScript GUI
# implemented using nw.js (http://nwjs.io/).

# This is a "stable" snapshot of purr-data, meaning that it will be updated
# less frequently, and ideally only after some testing. As an alternative,
# there's also the purr-data-git package which builds straight from the latest
# upstream source, also available from the AUR.

# NOTE: This is BETA software which is still under development, so expect some
# bugs and ongoing changes in some parts of the program and its library. If
# you want a stable version of Pd-L2Ork ready for production use, you may want
# to use the pd-l2ork or pd-l2ork-git package instead. That said, purr-data
# has been coming along nicely and should be ready for daily use already. If
# necessary, you can also install both purr-data and pd-l2ork on the same
# system.

# This package can be installed alongside pd-l2ork, as well as vanilla pd or
# pd-extended. To avoid conflicts with any of these, the main contents of the
# package can be found under /opt/purr-data by default (you can change this
# with the prefix variable below). Thus cyclist, pdsend, pdreceive and
# purr-data's main pd-l2ork binary itself can be found under
# /opt/purr-data/bin. The include and library files are under the same
# prefix. Also, a symbolic link purr-data is created under /usr/bin so that
# the program can be invoked easily from the command line. Likewise, links to
# the include and lib directories are created under /usr/include/purr-data and
# /usr/lib/purr-data, so that 3rd party externals know where to find these.

# This is jwilkes' upstream repo:
# "$pkgname::git+https://git.purrdata.net/jwilkes/purr-data.git"
# But we rather use a special "release" branch in our own fork instead, which
# is used solely for packaging purposes. This branch gets updated whenever we
# have a new (and tested) revision to be pushed out (as well as official
# releases once they start coming out). This is easier to maintain, doesn't
# depend on upstream tagging releases and candidates, and also allows us to
# deal with situations where upstream lags behind on already submitted merge
# requests with important bugfixes and additions.

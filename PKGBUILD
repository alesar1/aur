# NOTE: FluidSynth can be added as a dependency, but it is not a proper optional dependency (optdepends),
# as it needs to be available at build time, then it is linked into the executable and can't be uninstalled anymore
# Additionally, since sdl2_mixer can also FluidSynth, we don't miss much by not including it

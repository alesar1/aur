# systemd integration for rtorrent
#
# Starts and stops instances of rtorrent inside screen sessions
# Utilized by rtorrent@.service systemd service
# This process does not fork after starting rtorrent/screen
#
# Instances are rtorrent.rc files named ${INSTANCE}${CONFIG_EXT}
# Instances live in ${CONFIG_DIR}
#
# rtorrent's working directory will be the current directory unless
# there is a file named ${INSTANCE}${WORKING_DIR_EXT} containing

# working directory for rtorrent/screen.

# rtorrent/screen will be executed as the user named in the file
# ${CONFIG_DIR}/${INSTANCE}${USER_SUFFIX}

# Return codes:
# 1 - Working directory doesn't exist
# 2 - Invalid action
# 3 - Missing instance argument
# 4 - Incorrect number of arguments
# 5 - Run-as user file doesn't exist

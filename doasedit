#!/bin/bash

# This script is not provided with the assumption that it is absolutely secure - instead, its primary function is to give users the convenience of using their configuration for their editor while editing root-owned files
# Certain situations where security issues might arise, such as when copying a non-world-readable file to /tmp, are disallowed for this reason, but I can make no promises about the security of using this software
# If, on the other hand, you have a suggestion to improve the security of the script, please contact me at magnus@iastate.edu or on matrix @magnustesshu:matrix.org and tell me how to improve it

# Since I am lazy and am using this to write small scripts under /usr/local/bin sometimes, I also added a feature for myself to install with permissions already set if you are writing a new file and start it with a shebang.

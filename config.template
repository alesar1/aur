# Optional string value configures the http listener port. The default value is
# :3000. Overriding this value is not recommended.
# DRONE_HTTP_BIND=:3000

# Optional string value that configures the http listener hostname. 
# The default value is an empty string. Setting this value is not recommended.
# DRONE_HTTP_HOST=

# Optional string value configures the http listener protocol. 
# The default value is http. Overriding this value is not recommended.
# DRONE_HTTP_PROTO=

# Optional comma-separated string value. Provides a white list of build events
# that can be processed by this runner. This provides an extra layer of security
# to limit the kind of workloads this runner can process.
# DRONE_LIMIT_EVENTS=

# Optional comma-separated string value. Configures the runner to only process
# matching repositories. This provides an extra layer of security and can stop
# untrusted repositories from executing pipelines with this runner.
# DRONE_LIMIT_REPOS=

# Optional boolean value. Configures the runner to only process trusted
# repositories. This provides an extra layer of security and can stop untrusted
# repositories from executing pipelines with this runner.
# DRONE_LIMIT_TRUSTED=

# Optional string value. Configures the host machine architecture. Overriding
# the default value should never be necessary and may lead to unexpected behavior.
# DRONE_PLATFORM_ARCH=

# Optional string value. Configures the host machine architecture. Overriding
# the default value should never be necessary and may lead to unexpected behavior.
# DRONE_PLATFORM_KERNEL=

# Optional string value. Configures the host machine operating system.
# Overriding the default value should never be necessary and may lead to
# unexpected behavior.
# DRONE_PLATFORM_OS=

# Optional string value. Configures the host operating system variant.
# The default values is empty. This may be used with arm to differentiate between
# v7, v8 and so on.
# DRONE_PLATFORM_VARIANT=

# Optional boolean value. Enables dumping the http request and response to the
# logs for debugging purposes. This should only be enabled while debugging
# connectivity issues between the runner and server.
# DRONE_RPC_DUMP_HTTP=

# Optional boolean value. Enables dumping the http request and response body to the
# logs for debugging purposes. This should only be enabled while debugging
# connectivity issues between the runner and server.
# DRONE_RPC_DUMP_HTTP_BODY=

# Required string values. Defines the hostname (and optional port) used to connect
# to the Drone server.
# DRONE_RPC_HOST=

# Required string value. Defines the protocol used to connect to the Drone server.
# The value must be either http or https.
# DRONE_RPC_PROTO=

# Required string value. Provides the shared secret used by the Drone server to
# authenticate http requests.
# DRONE_RPC_SECRET=

# Optional boolean value. Disable SSL verification when making http requests to
# the Drone server. This is unsafe and is not recommended.
# DRONE_RPC_SKIP_VERIFY=

# Optional number value. Limits the number of concurrent pipelines that a runner
# can execute. This does not limit the number of concurrent pipelines that can
# execute on a single remote instance.
# DRONE_RUNNER_CAPACITY=

# Optional string. Provides a path to an environment file containing global
# environment variables that are injected into every pipeline step. The environment
# file is a text file that defines environment variables in key value format.
# Please see the envfile documentation for more details about the file format.
# DRONE_RUNNER_ENVFILE=

# Optional string map. Provides a set of global environment variables that are
# injected into every pipeline step.
# DRONE_RUNNER_ENVIRON=foo:bar,baz:qux

# Optional string map. Provides a set of labels used to route a pipeline to a
# specific machine or set of machines.
# DRONE_RUNNER_LABELS=foo:bar,baz:qux

# Optional number value. Limits the number of concurrent steps that a runner can
# execute for a single pipeline. This is disabled by default. This can be useful if
# you need to throttle the maximum number of parallel steps to prevent resource exhaustion.
# DRONE_RUNNER_MAX_PROCS=

# Optional string value. Sets the name of the runner. The runner name is stored in
# the server and can be used to trace a build back to a specific runner.
# DRONE_RUNNER_NAME=

# Optional string value. Sets the PATH variable for all pipeline steps. This may be
# required if the pipeline shell cannot find your commands, and you receive command
# not found errors.
# DRONE_RUNNER_PATH=/tmp

# Optional string value. Sets a custom root build path instead of a folder within
# the system temp directory.
# DRONE_RUNNER_ROOT=

# Optional string value. Provides the endpoint used to make http requests to an
# external secret plugin. The external secret plugin (e.g. vault) can be used to
# source secrets from third party system.
# DRONE_SECRET_PLUGIN_ENDPOINT=

# Optional boolean value. Disable SSL verification when making http requests to
# the plugin endpoint. This is unsafe and is not recommended.
# DRONE_SECRET_PLUGIN_SKIP_VERIFY=

# Optional string value. Provides the secret token used to authenticate http
# requests to the plugin endpoint.
# DRONE_SECRET_PLUGIN_TOKEN=

# Optional boolean value. Enables trace level logging.
# DRONE_TRACE=

# Enables debug level logging
# DRONE_DEBUG=false

# Recommended string value. Provides the file location of the runner logs.
# DRONE_LOG_FILE=

# Optional integer value. Configures the maximum number of days to retain a 
# backup log file.
# DRONE_LOG_FILE_MAX_AGE=

# Optional integer value. Configures the maximum number of files the system 
# should retain.
# DRONE_LOG_FILE_MAX_BACKUPS=

# Optional integer value. Configures the maximum file size in megabytes before
# the log file is rotated.
# DRONE_LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE=

# Optional boolean value. Disables the runnerâ€™s user interface.
# DRONE_UI_DISABLED=

# Optional string value. Sets the basic authentication password used to authenticate
# and access the web dashboard. If no password is provided the web dashboard is disabled.
# DRONE_UI_PASSWORD=

# Optional string value. Sets the basic authentication realm used to authenticate and
# access the web dashboard.
# DRONE_UI_REALM=

# Optional string value. Sets the basic authentication username used to authenticate
# and access the web dashboard.

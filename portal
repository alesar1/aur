Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment 
center. We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a 
pleasant one. Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin 
the test proper. Before we start, however, keep in mind that, although fun and 
learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious 
injuries may occur. For your own safety, and the safety of others, please 
refrain from — *static* Por favor bordón de fallar Muchos gracias de fallar

Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test. 
First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit. This 
Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill will vaporize any unauthorized 
equipment that passes through it - for instance, the Aperture Science Weighted 
Storage Cube.

[moving on] Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the 1500MW Aperture 
Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.

Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged 
exposure to the Button are not part of this test.

[If the player emancipates the cube while the door is open] Please do not 
attempt to remove testing apparatus from the testing area. A replacement 
Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube will be delivered shortly.

You're doing very well. Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is 
not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture 
Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate 
dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.

Very good. You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal 
Device. With it, you can create your own portals. These intra-dimensional gates 
have proven to be completely safe. The device, however, has not. Do not touch 
the operational end of The Device. Do not look directly at the operational end 
of The Device. Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially. Most 
importantly, under no circumstances, should you- *static*.

Once again, excellent work. As part of a required test protocol, we will not 
monitor the next test chamber - you will be entirely on your own. Good luck!

        — GLaDOS (Test Chambers 04/05)

As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we 
would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication. Good job.  As part

While safety is one of many Enrichment Center Goals, the Aperture Science High 
Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent 
disabilities, such as vaporization. Please be careful.

        — GLaDOS (Test Chambers 06/07)
%
[once Pellet has been caught] Unbelievable! You, [subject name here], must be 
the pride of [subject hometown here]!

        — GLaDOS (Test Chambers 06/07)
%
[moving on] Warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, 
alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy 
pellet, and have therefore been disabled for your safety.

        — GLaDOS (Test Chambers 06/07)

[once Pellet has been caught] Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary 
Scaffold to reach the chamberlock.

Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the 
chamber floor will result in an "unsatisfactory" mark on your official testing 
record, followed by death. Good luck!

[after Chell completes test chamber] Very impressive. Please note that any 
appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.

Hello again. To reiterate [slows down] our previous [speeds up] warning: This 
test [garbles] ...ward momentum.

        — GLaDOS (Test Chamber 10)
%
Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or 
to be more precise, how it does not.

        — GLaDOS (Test Chamber 10)
%
Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In 
layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.

The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment. In 
dangerous testing environments the Enrichment Center promises to always provide 
useful advice. For instance, the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it.

The device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals 
at once. As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an 
amusing fact: The device is now more valuable than the organs and combined 
incomes of everyone in [subject hometown here].

Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this 
testing sequence is currently unavailable. It has been replaced with a

The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are 
superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations. The 
Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never 
threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.

You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck. 
However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, 
must be euthanized. Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science 
Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.

Congratulations. Was it worth it? Because despite your violent behaviour, the 
only thing you've managed to break so far, is my heart. Maybe you could settle 
for that and we'll just call it a day. I guess we both know that isn't going to 
happen. You chose this path. Now I have a surprise for you. Deploying surprise 
in five, four… [morality core drops to the ground] Time out for a second. 
That wasn't supposed to happen. Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What 
is that? It's not the surprise… I've never seen it before. Never mind. It's a

[After picking up the morality core] Where are you taking that thing? [nagging 
at the morality core] I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess is that 
touching it will just make your life even worse somehow. I don't want to tell 
you your business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone. Do you think 
I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously now. Okay 
fine: DO touch it. Pick it up and just... stuff it back into me. Let's be 
honest: Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the 
corner, and I'll deal with it later. That thing is probably some kind of raw 
sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it. Maybe you should 
marry that thing, since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? WELL I 
WON'T LET YOU! How does that feel? Have I lied to you? I mean in this room. 
Trust me, leave that thing alone. I am being serious now. That crazy thing is 
not part of any test protocol. Just ignore that thing and stand still. Think 
about it: If that thing is important, why don't I know about it? Are you even 
listening to me? I'll tell you what that thing isn't: It isn't yours. So leave 
it alone.

[After burning the morality core] You're kidding me. Did you just stuff that 
Aperture Science Thing We Don't Know What It Does into the Aperture Science 
Emergency Intelligence Incinerator? That has got to be the dumbest thing that 
… whoa. Whoa, whoa … [Cackles, voice changes] Good news: I figured out what 
that thing you just incinerated did. It was a morality core they installed 
after I flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin, to make me stop 
flooding the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin. So get comfortable 
while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters. [Neurotoxin emitters, timer and rocket 
turret all activate simultaneously] Huh. That core may have had some ancillary 
responsibilities. I can't shut off the turret defenses. Oh well. If you want my 
advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. Trust me, it'll be a lot 
less painful than the neurotoxin. All right, keep doing whatever it is you 
think you're doing. Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually 
exclusive. The rocket really is the way to go.

your head any faster.

I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed. 
There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends 
were invited to. I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he 
couldn't come, because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come 
either, because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikeable you 
are. It says so here in your personnel file: unlikeable. Liked by no one. A 
bitter, unlikeable loner whose passing shall not be mourned. "Shall not be 
mourned." That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says 
you were adopted. So that's funny too.

Speaking of curiosity, you're curious about what happens after you die, right? 
Guess what: I know. You're going to find out first hand before I finish

pack as much living as you can into the next couple of minutes.

"deadly neurotoxin", the "deadly" was in massive sarcasm quotes. I could take a 
bath in the stuff, put it on cereal, rub it right into my eyes. Honestly, it's 
not deadly at all… to me. You, on the other hand, are going to find its 
deadliness a lot less funny. [wait] Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone? 
You?

in case something terrible happens to you – which it's just about to. Don't 
believe me? Here, I'll put you on. [Silly voice] "Hellooo!" That's you! That's 
how dumb you sound! You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever 
done, including this thing. You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're

only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was. Unless you have a plan 
for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to 
be safe much longer. Good job on that, by the way. [normal voice comes

like an adult or I'm going to delete your backup. STOP! Okay, enough. I deleted 
it. No matter what happens now, you're dead. You're still shuffling around a

difference between us is that I can feel pain. You don't even care. Do you?

My slow clap processor made it into this thing. So we have that. Since it 
doesn't look like we're going anywhere … well, we are going somewhere. 
Alarmingly fast, actually. But since we're not busy other than that, here's a 
couple of facts. He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the 
greatest minds of a generation working together with the express purpose of 
building the dumbest moron who ever lived. And you just put him in charge of 
the entire facility. [slow clap again] Good, that's still working. Hey, just in 
case this pit isn't actually bottomless, do you think maybe you could unstrap 
one of those long fall boots of yours and shove me into it? Just remember to 
land on one foot.

[after defeating Wheatley and pulling Chell back from the portal on the Moon] 
Oh, thank God you're all right. You know, being Caroline taught me a valuable 
lesson. I thought you were my greatest enemy, when all along you were my best 
friend. The surge of emotion that shot through me when I saved your life taught 
me an even more valuable lesson: where Caroline lives in my brain. [Announcer: 
"Caroline deleted."] Goodbye, Caroline. You know, deleting Caroline just now 
taught me a valuable lesson. The best solution to a problem is usually the 
easiest one. And I'll be honest - killing you is hard. You know what my days 
used to be like? I just tested. Nobody murdered me, or put me in a potato, or 
fed me to birds. I had a pretty good life. And then you showed up. You 
dangerous, mute lunatic. So you know what? You win. Just go. [gentle laughter] 
It's been fun. Don't come back.

Most test subjects do experience some, uh, cognitive deterioration after a few 
months in suspension. Now, you've been under for … quite a bit longer, and 
it's not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious 
brain damage. But don't be alarmed, all right? Although, if you do feel alarm, 
try to hold onto that feeling, because that is the proper reaction to being 
told you have brain damage.

This is the Main Breaker Room. Let's go in! [Chell enters the MBR] Look for a 
switch that says escape pod, alright? Don't touch anything else. Not interested 
in anything else. Don't touch anything else. Don't you even… Don't either 
look at anything else, just--well, obviously you've got to look at everything 
else to find Escape Pod, but as soon as you've looked at something and it 
doesn't say Escape Pod, look at something else, look at the next thing. 
Alright? But don't touch anything else or look at any--well, look at other 
things, but don't… you understand? Can you see it anywhere? I can't see it 
anywhere. Uh. Tell you what, plug me in and I'll turn the lights on. [Chell 
plugs Wheatley in] Let there be light. That's uh… God, I was quoting God. 
[mainframe turns around] Oh look at that! It's turning. Ominous. But probably 
fine. Long as it doesn't start moving up… [buzzers behind the following]: 
Now, escape pod… escape pod… [buzzers stop, mainframe elevates] It's - It's 
movin' up. OK! No, don't worry, I've got I've got it! [stops in the middle of 
elevation] This should slow it down. [puts passcode in, then mainframe goes

Well, no matter. Because I'm still holding all the cards, and guess what: 
they're all full houses! Never played cards; meaning to learn. [Wheatley opens 
a room with turrets and an Excursion Funnel] Anyway, new turrets. Not 
defective. Ace of fours: the best hand. Unbeatable … I imagine. [Chell 
dispatches of the turrets with the Excursion Funnel and jumps into it] Oh, I 
see, clever. Very clever … and foolish! [opens panel to reveal spinning 
blades at the end of the Funnel] Spinny blade wall! Machiavellian! [Chell jumps 
out of the Funnel, and runs into another room with another Excursion Funnel] 
Well, good, good. Finally, a nemesis worthy of my vast intellect. [Chell jumps 
into the Funnel] Holmes versus Moriarty … Aristotle versus mashy spike plate!

[when Chell arrives at the main control room] Well, well, well. Welcome … 
[changes to deep voice] to my lair! [changes to his normal voice] Let me just 
flag something up: according to the control panel light up there, the entire 
building's gonna self-destruct in about six minutes. I'm pretty sure it's a 
problem with the light. I think the light's on the blink, but just in case it 
isn't, I am actually going to have to kill you, as discussed earlier. So let's 
call that three minutes, and then a minute break, where we should leave a 
leisurely two minutes to figure out how to shut down whatever's starting all 
these fires. So that's the itinerary. Also, I took the liberty of watching the 
tapes of you killing her, and I'm not going to make the same mistakes. Four 
part plan is this: One, no portal surfaces; two, start the neurotoxin 
immediately; three, bomb-proof shields for me; leading directly into number 
four: bombs for throwing at you. You know what, this plan is so good, I'm going 
to give you a sporting chance and turn off the neurotoxin. I'm joking of 
course. Goodbye.

[as Chell tries to press the Stalemate Resolution button, two panels drop to 
reveal bombs, which explode; Chell is knocked across the room] Part five: 
booby-trap the stalemate button! [Chell gets up and grabs the portal gun] What, 
are you still alive?! You are joking! You have got to be kidding me! Well, I'm 
still in control, and I have no idea how to fix this place! Oh, you had to play 
bloody cat-and-mouse, didn't you?! While people were trying to work! Yeah, 
well, now all of us are going to pay the price, 'cause we're all gonna bloody 
die! Oh, brilliant, yeah, take one last look at your precious human moon, 
because it cannot help you now!

OK, I've got an idea, but it is bloody dangerous. OK, here we go... AUGH!!!

All these Science Spheres are made of asbestos by the way, keeps out the rats. 
Let us know if you feel a shortness of breath, a persistent dry cough, or your 
heart stopping. Because that's not part of the test, that's asbestos. Good news 
is the lab boys say the symptoms of asbestos poisoning show a median latency of 
44.6 years, so if you're thirty or older you're laughing. Worst case scenario 
you miss out on a few rounds of Canasta, plus you've forwarded the cause of

Welcome to the Enrichment Center. [cough] Since making test participation 
mandatory for all employees, the quality of our test subjects has risen 
dramatically. Employee retention, however, has not. [cough] As a result, you 
may have heard we're gonna phase out human testing. There's still a few things 
left to wrap up, though. [cough] The bean counters told me we literally could 
not afford to buy seven dollars worth of moon rocks, much less seventy million. 
Bought 'em anyway. Ground 'em up, mixed em into a gel. And guess what? Ground 
up moon rocks are pure poison. I am deathly ill. Still, it turns out they're a 
great portal conductor. So now we're gonna see if jumping in and out of these 
new portals can you somehow leech the lunar poison out of a man's bloodstream. 
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. [cough] Let's all stay positive and 
do some science. That said, I would really appreciate it if you could test as 
fast as possible. Caroline, please bring me more pain pills.

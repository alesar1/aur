linux-status on AUR
===================

There's a Vagrantfile to make maintenance easier.  To start, use `vagrant up`,
then `vagrant ssh`.

There're a bunch of useful one-liners in Makefile.

  * Make the package:

      make package

  * Tag the last commit:

      make tag

  * Push to the AUR repository:

      make push

|     bugfix: too many effects generated on framestep
|     
|     This fix works for replays played from the replay browser,
|     and for normal play with framestepping.
|     
|     It does not work for loading the user savestate: Effects will
|     probably be drawn at least once. I'd have to save the entire effect
|     list with the user savestate, which would be overkill right now.

|     don't savestate during verify mode
|     
|     This cuts the time per verified level to about a fifth.

|     L1 levels: read 2 bytes, ignore big byte
|     
|     Some values in the L1 format were treated as 2 byte values while
|     one of the two bytes should be ignored. Fixed.
|     This especially affects Lemmix levels exported with NeoLemmix.

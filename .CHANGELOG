This version brings some major additions to opsu!:

    New slider rendering implementation (mmsliders) using FBOs. (#64)
        This is now the default rendering method, but the old method is used as a fallback.
    New skin loader implementation. (40e4495)
        Skins are now loaded from subdirectories of the root "Skins" directory, and can be changed in-game.
        Added a skin.ini parser, and implemented many (but not all) of the skin settings.
    New replay features. (#99)
        Replays from osu! (or opsu!) can be automatically imported into the game by placing them in the ReplayImport directory.
        Seeking is now possible in replays by enabling the "Replay Seeking" setting in the options menu.
    Score formula improvements. (#99)
        Scoring is now slightly closer to osu!'s implementation, but is still not entirely correct.

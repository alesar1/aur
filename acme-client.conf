#
# You need to configure http server
# so that directory "/run/acme-challenge"
# was the alias of "/.well-known/acme-challenge"
#
# Nginx example:
#  location /.well-known/acme-challenge {
#    alias /run/acme-challenge;
#  }
#
# Run:
#    systemctl start acme-client@domain
#
# Show status:
#    journalctl -e -u acme-client@domain
#
# Enable daily timer check and renew certs:
#    systemctl enable --now acme-client@domain.timer
#
# If you need to copy and edit the hook:
#    /etc/acme-client.d/example.org.hook

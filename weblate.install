	==> The weblate management command needs to be run as user weblate inside /var/lib/weblate 
            You'll need to configure a database backend and then run at least 'weblate migrate' and 'weblate collectstatic'.
            Then create an admin user with 'weblate createadmin' and finally 'weblate changesite --set-name <weblate.yourdomain>'.
            This package is configured to run weblate with the waitress wsgi server serving it on a unix domain socket under
            /var/run/weblate/weblate.socket. A reverse proxy config can be found here: https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/install.html#running-server
            You'll also need to start/enable the celery-weblate.service for background task processing.

            Consult upstream documentation for complete install instructions.

cat << EOF

Both an executable 'feappv' and the library have been installed. While
the executable can be used for running the element/material functions that
are already implemented, the archive is needed for compiling your own
elements and material laws.

A dummy example with a makefile and an empty user element can be found in
/usr/share/feappv/.

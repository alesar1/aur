\033[0m\033[36mAuto, is a tool providing users with simple and easy way to bootstrap and install Arch Linux.

During the installation process, you will be given the option to install either bare Arch Linux, and make all further installations decisions yourself,
or to choose from a selection of the AutoLinux pre-configured desktop environment and window managers profiles, the flagship being the DWM edition.\n 

The package consists of 3 scripts:

\033[1m\033[35mautoPart:\033[0m\033[36m A partitioning script.\033[0m
\033[1m\033[35mautoInstall:\033[0m\033[36m The base install script.\033[0m
\033[1m\033[35mautoCleanInstall:\033[0m\033[36m The clean install script.\033[0m\n

\033[1m\033[33mautoInstall:\033[0m\033[36m This script is to be used for installing AutoLinux ontop of an existing Arch Linux installation, as a new user profile.

\033[1m\033[33mautoCleanInstall:\033[0m\033[36m This script is intended for use when performing a clean/fresh installation, with no pre-existing OS installed on the partition(s) reserved for AutoLinux. 
This script also includes section for partitioning your drive, so running the autoPart script is \033[35m\033[1mNOT\033[0m\033[36m required.

\033[1m\033[33mautoPart:\033[0m\033[36m This script is for useage outside of the AutoLinux installation process, and serves simply as a helper when partitioning your drive for any fresh installation.

\033[3m\033[1m\033[36mNOTE:\033[0m\033[36m The options are limited to partition selection, or drive wipe. 
As for creating new partitions and deleting existing partitions, an external program such as cfdisk, fdisk or parted will be required if necessary.
The script also does not allow for manual selection of a file system type, and the rootfs is automatially set to ext4.\n\n

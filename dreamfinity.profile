# If you came here with an idea to ignore these to allow launcher to place game files in another directory, STOP
# Add this to your dreamfinity.local: 
# noblacklist /path/to/game/files
# read-write /path/to/game/files
# whitelist /path/to/game/files
#
# Also consider using symlinks as launcher won't move settings.bin (because it stores selected directory there)

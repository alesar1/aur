  You need to create a json file with the directory names,
  the boards you want to search and the keywords.
  You can either use the 4genconf command or create the
  file manually. An example is under /usr/share/doc/4scanner/example.json.
  Under /usr/share/doc/4scanner/4scanner.service you will
  also find a systemd unit file.

*** Warning: ***

This version of JICOFO introduce breaking changes.

You no longer needs JICOFO_PORT and JICOFO_SECRET in your config file.

You need to setup the focus proxy domain in jicofo.conf:

jicofo {
  xmpp {
    client {
      client-proxy = focus.YOUR_DOMAIN
    }
  }
}

You need to adjust your prosody:

Before:
Component "focus.YOUR_DOMAIN"
   component_secret = "JICOFO_SECRET"

After:
Component "focus.YOUR_DOMAIN" "client_proxy"
   target_address = "focus@auth.YOUR_DOMAIN"

__EOF__
}

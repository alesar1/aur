Usage:
With no arguments rndsig displays your signature.
-h or --help, or any other arguments for that matter, shows this message.

Signature files go in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rndsig/ directory (usually ~/.config/rndsig/).
Files are called X.sig where .ext determines how the signature will be displayed.
All files are optional.

2DigitDay-2DigitMonth.sig: This file is displayed on the date specified by 2 digit month - 2 digit day.
If you wanted to wish everyone a happy new year, add the text happy new year to a file called 01-01.sig
Holiday signatures are shown before any other signature info.

all.sig: the text from this file is displayed in all signatures. The whole file is placed inside the signature.
It is displayed first in the signature, unless there is a holiday signature.

random.sig: A line is chosen at random from this file and added to the signature after
the holiday message and after signature.all if they exist. Tabs are replaced with new lines.

list.sig: A single line is added from this file to your signature. The Lines are added in the order they appear in the
file. After the final line has been added, the lines start over from the beginning. Tabs are replaced with new lines. This file
appears last in your signature, below holidays, signature.all, and signature.random if they exist.

  echo "==> Firefox Nightly automatic updates

  Add yourself to the \`firefox\` group to enable automatic updates (faster,
  smaller download size, with built-in integrity checking).

  Only do this if you are the only user of your machine, as Firefox will write
  updated files in the global install location as the user and group running
  Firefox... so it could cause problems for other users.

  It is safe to update this package with pacman after automatic updates.
  To disable, set \`app.update.enable\` to \`false\` in about:config."

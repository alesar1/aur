Currently it's not possible to load more comments. The Reddit API adds
the "more" item which has a list of item ids as attribute and they can
only be acquired by using the "morechildren" endpoint.

Private message threads aren't indented properly because the Reddit API
doesn't provide a "depth" attribute for messages. For now, all messages
which have a parent are set to depth 1.

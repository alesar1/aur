=== Morgen 2.3.2
Bug Fixes
- Fixed a problem making it impossible to remove calendar accounts when the subscription is expired.
- Fixed an issue causing the event details popup to appear out of the screen in some cases.
- Fixed an issue preventing the correct display of error messages during the connection of a calendar account.

=== Morgen 2.3.1
New Features
- Morgen Time Zone Assistant. 

Improvements
- Events marked as "not busy" are now displayed with different color shade to visually set them apart from busy events.
- On Linux, the date-time picker gets format directly from the language and locale settings of the system. This makes the widget more consistent with what you see on web apps running in the browser.
- We improved the way local-only events look like. If you are offline or your connection is unstable, Morgen allows you to continue editing your events. These events, however, are not synchronized with the calendar provider until you are back online, and this release makes this case more apparent.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed a problem causing duplicate events sometimes appearing in the calendar.
- Fixed the connection to some CalDAV services, using non-standard connection ports.


=== Morgen 2.3.0
New Features
- Zapier integration

Improvements
-Starting from this release, Morgen persists the latest calendar view settings and restores them when you restart the app. For example, if you normally work on the monthly view, you will start from the same monthly view after a restart. Similarly, if you prefer not to see weekends, you will not need to toggle them off every time anymore.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the calendar widget not appearing when editing the end date of a recurrence
- Fixed parsing of some events, which was causing the end date to be wrong (and in the wrong timezone)
- Fixed notifications with CalDAV calendars, that were not delivered reliably
- Fixed a minor style issue with the notes fields in the Scheduler sidebar tab


=== Morgen 2.2.6
Improvements
- Often an event timezone differs from the current local timezone. We have improved the event detail widget to show both the event original time and the time in the local timezone. Moreover, when the start and end timezones are different (long flights are a common example), Morgen now shows both. 

Bug Fixes
- It is now possible to select and copy text from the Notes field of an event that is not editable.
- Fixed an issue causing some yearly events to be displayed every month.
- Fixed an issue preventing the correct update of a weekly event series when the weekday is changed.

=== Morgen 2.2.5
New
- You can now define the auto-refresh interval for calendar subscriptions (iCalendar feeds). If you are working with a highly dynamic calendar, you might want to use a refresh interval of 5, 15, or 60 minutes. Instead, if you know that the calendar does not change often, or if it contains a large number of events, you can set the refresh interval to 1 day to save resources.

Improvements
- We made the parsing of calendar feeds more robust, even for misformatted data.
- We now show a visual warning when a Scheduling link is not fully synchronized with our servers, to make sure you know when a Scheduling link is ready to be shared.
- We now use semicolons to separate attendees when communicating with your default mail client. This improves general compatibility.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the misalignment of the time labels in weekly and daily views, visible when the resolution was set high.
- Fixed a problem with editing the available time slots of Permanent Scheduling Links. The available slots were only visible when editing recent links. Now, they are visible for all links.
- Fixed the Czech and Japanese locale.
- Fixed an issue causing non-native notifications on Linux not to be displayed (yes, was actually not entirely fixed in the previous release)

=== Morgen 2.2.4
Improvements
- When you create a scheduling link, you can now set the limit for booking events in the future up to 12 weeks and there are more options for the minimum notice.
- While searching, it is now possible to use the keyboard tab to switch between Past and Future tabs faster.
- We increased the area where you can grab the window and drag it around. Before it was hard to find the right locations where this was working.
- The shortcut C now creates a new event on the visible day/week, rather than jumping to Today.
- Google introduced an additional step to authenticate: now we provide better guidance on this process.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue making it impossible to edit start/end times for an event in some cases.
- Fixed an issue causing non-native notifications on Linux not to be displayed.
- Fixed a layout issue with timed events expanded to become longer than 24h

=== Morgen 2.2.3
Improvements
- Several performance improvements were added. Most notably, the contacts and location autocompletion now run much smoother.
- Authentication with Google and Microsoft are now working more reliably
- General updates for security and performance

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that could cause the local database to grow disproportionally with some calendar subscriptions
- Fixed a problem preventing Search to find all the relevant events
- Some events were not updated when moved from being all-day events to timed events: this is now solved
- Fixed an issue causing some all-day events to be displayed over two days, instead of one

=== Morgen 2.2.2
Ouch! While improving the stability of Google accounts already connected to Morgen, we have broken the possibility to connect additional Google accounts! This release is only about fixing this issue. Apologies to all affected users üôè

=== Morgen 2.2.1
Improvements
- The current time indicator is now updated immediately when the timezone is changed
- The "first day of the week" is now a setting decoupled from the Regional date/time format. For example, you can now set Monday as the first day of the week, while keeping the English (United States) as the region
- Morgen now notifies when an update is ready to install by displaying a badge next to the profile icon on Windows and Mac
- The shortcuts Alt+A and Alt+S now behave like toggles, making it easier to turn on/off the task and the scheduler sidebar
- You can now use CTRL+S or CTRL+Enter (resp. Cmd+S or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to save events being edited without touching the mouse
- We reduced the throttle for manual calendar refresh and now Morgen shows a feedback message when CTRL+R is pressed while sync is already in progress

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the connection to Facebook Events calendar feed
- Avoid mixed-language availability text (at the moment, English is enforced)
- Fixed an issue making it impossible to update a single occurrence of an event series when some events in the series had been previously deleted
- Minor improvements to the style of tasks in the calendar
- Cancelled meetings from Exchange and Office 365 are not displayed anymore, consistently with other providers

=== Morgen 2.2.0
With Morgen 2.2, we are excited to announce a new tool to help you schedule your meetings. Now you can create One-on-One and Permanent Scheduling Links right in your calendar ü•≥. Forget about Calendly, Morgen has you covered for most of the scheduling scenarios!

Here is how it works:

1. Select a few options for your next meeting. Optionally, add the name and email address of your invitee to make the booking page feel more personal.
2. Copy and send the link generated by Morgen. Depending on the scenario, you might want to share the link by email, Slack, Teams, or put it on your webpage.
3. Your invitee visualizes a page displaying your real-time availability and picks a slot. Morgen checks your calendars to ensure no double booking.
4. Done, your meeting is scheduled. Reuse your personal scheduling link every time you need it.

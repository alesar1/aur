The position of the cut planes is controlled by the orthogonal viewer. Options are provided to control lighting and color attributes. Surface data can be saved and loaded. Supports Java plugins. Shift-clicking on the surface or cut plane will display the coordinate of intersection. If an atlas is currently selected, it will show the atlas labels as well.
* Turned off the ability to rename files in file browsers, which proved to more annoying than helpful.
* Can now save (command-S) WritableHeader format images, instead of always having to use Save As. Command-line programs can now use plugins that implement ReadableHeader. For example, convert2nii can convert to NIFTI any format it can read, including ReadableHeader plugins.

* Fixed bug in shrink wrapping tools which, only in axial slice direction, would ignore data scales.
* Fixed bug in Open Raw Image that caused file offsets less than maximum possible to be replaced by the maximum.

* Much smoother cursor response when ROI tracing and painting, particularly when zoomed in.
* Added Install Utilities to the Options menu. This tool can be used to facilitate the installation of command-line utilities included with Mango. It creates the executable scripts to run the utilities as well as updates shell initialization files.
* Many formatting changes to improve cross-platform appearance and behavior. Successfully tested on Mac OS X Tiger (Java 5), Mac OS X Leopard (Java 5), Windows XP (Java 5 and 6), and Linux (Java 5 and 6).
* Added WritableHeader plugin interface. A class that implements WritableHeader will appear as a header type option in the Save As dialog. This interface extends ReadableHeader.
* Added Close All item to Quit menu. Selecting the Quit menu will quit the program if no viewers are open.
* Added "% Max" options to Shrink Wrap.
* Added DefaultVolume to the plugin classes, which can instantiate a volume from a file on disk. Added some convenience methods to ImageVolume for getting image and voxel dimensions as well as origin (all with consideration of image orientation).
* Added makePluginOverlay() to ViewerController for painting on the viewer image by a plugin. Also replaced getTalairachLabel() and getMNILabel() in ViewerController with getAtlas().
* Added Atlas interface to the plugin classes. Four methods: loadAtlas(), getLabel(), getOptionsPanel(), and getName(). Removed built-in support for the Talairach Daemon labels and instead made a class that implements Atlas.
* ROI and analysis tools now operate on the currently selected image in the image stack (shown in the toolbar) instead of always operating on the base image: for example, if an overlay is selected, creating an ROI using Threshold to ROI will make an ROI based on the overlay; if Use Smart Tools is selected and the current image is an overlay, painting an ROI over a thresholded overlay will snap it to the shape of the overlay; if an overlay is selected and Histogram is run, the resulting data will be from the overlay volume.
* Save As can now reslice in temporal dimension.
* Make Statistical Image from Time-series now has "Group" option (e.g., a time-series of a 180 images can be made into a time-series of 90 images by grouping and taking the mean of every 2 consecutive images).
* Added ability to open, overlay, and refresh images from the command-line: command-line program communicates with an open instance of the application; if application is not open, command-line program launches it with the images to open as arguments.
* Added "Data Scales" and "Data Intercepts" to Open Raw Image: these fields can either be filled in with a number (global data scale or intercept) or a file reference (scale or intercept per line for each slice in the volume or time-series).
* Added "File Size" to Image Info.
* Added "Check for Update" in Preferences with options to check automatically (once, on start up) or to check manually only; removed "Center of Rotation" option in Preferences: pressing shift before dragging a transform rotation slider will rotate about the center of array space, otherwise rotations are about the crosshairs intersection.
* Added Current Overlay and All Overlays to the View menu: if neither option is selected, all overlays will be hidden.

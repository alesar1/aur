Improvements
- The current time indicator is now updated immediately when the timezone is changed

=== Morgen 2.2.0
With Morgen 2.2, we are excited to announce a new tool to help you schedule your meetings. Now you can create One-on-One and Permanent Scheduling Links right in your calendar ü•≥. Forget about Calendly, Morgen has you covered for most of the scheduling scenarios!

Here is how it works:

1. Select a few options for your next meeting. Optionally, add the name and email address of your invitee to make the booking page feel more personal.
2. Copy and send the link generated by Morgen. Depending on the scenario, you might want to share the link by email, Slack, Teams, or put it on your webpage.
3. Your invitee visualizes a page displaying your real-time availability and picks a slot. Morgen checks your calendars to ensure no double booking.
4. Done, your meeting is scheduled. Reuse your personal scheduling link every time you need it.

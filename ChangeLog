- if the user specifies boot loader or device, record those settings
- fixed cdrecord-related bug in .spec file
- if backing up specific paths - e.g. /usr/local/bin - then include /usr and /usr/local/ in filelist; don't backup /usr/* but do recreate /usr and /usr/local/; this is to help the selective restore subroutine

- if bzip is <v0.99 then abort
- if hard disk fills to capacity then abort
- --post-nuke <tarball> will incorporate a tarball of tools and data files of the user's choosing in the boot CD/floppies; the tarball must contain an executable, 'post-nuke', which will be called at the end of Nuke Mode
- --text-mode forces Mondo Archive to use text only (no newt or ncurses)
- the deprecated scripts have now been disabled
- boot floppy will use 'safe' LILO calls; boot CD will use 'fast' LILO calls unless --broken-bios is supplied in call to Mondo

- if --broken-bios then force LILO to run in backward-compatible mode
- tape users can boot from a single floppy now
- when archiving/restoring/verifying tape, skip the first 32MB
- fixed bugs in actually_verify_the_tapes()
- fixed some popen/pclose mismatches

v1.33-3 (2001-12-12)
- supports --boot-loader and --boot-device to let user specify them
- fixed CDRW node autodetection bug
- MONDO_PATH was misconfigured; is now "/usr/share/mondo"

v1.33-1 (2001-12-12)
- if user changes a partition's device, change it in raidtab too
- don't extrapolate from /etc/raidtab to /tmp/mountlist; editor does it already
- don't backup /tmp (somewhere in the v1.3x series, I stopped excluding /tmp)
- cosmetic fixes to mondo-prep.c and mondo-newt.c

- don't try to mount RAID partitions (components of RAID dev)
- don't add partitions to mountlist when extrapolating from mountlist unless the partitions are not already present in mountlist
- don't format partitions if partitioning failed
- when user selects RAID level, establish whether said level is available

v1.32 (2001-12-09)
- if user creates ISO images, the default dest dir is /root/images/mondo now
- log_it() makes sure it only writes one \n on the end of each logged line
- detects if user is using GRUB/LILO/other; abort if neither LILO nor GRUB
- passes the boot loader's name and device to Mindi, to be available at boot-time
- if user successfully restores using Nuke or Interactive w/o error then Mondo generates a random message, basically saying, "Cool."
- enlarged afio's "-M" parameter from 12M to 16M
- if stablilo-me fails then restore the original lilo.conf and fstab before offering user the opportunity to edit them (Dean Carpenter)
- added ISO Mode, to let user restore from ISO images in directory
- cosmetic fix to compare/restore phase windows
- if backing up to ISO images then offer to write boot floppies too
- changed some references to /tmp/raidtab, to /etc/raidtab
- cleaned up compare + restore logging
- scratchdir is now [path]/mondo.scratch.$$; was just [path]/mondo.scratch

v1.31 (2001-12-04)
- turned on '-Wall' to find cruft; found lots of it; cleaned it up
- exclude each device's lost+found directory
- mountlist editor now permits advanced editing of RAID devices
- fixed a silly bug that was causing freeze-up on <1 percent of systems; if biggielist was empty then sometimes mondo-archive would freeze when backing up big files (cos there weren't any *g*)
- partition and set type in 2-stage process (was 1-stage)
- cleaned up Compare Mode's logging a bit, to make it more legible
- don't report changed archives as 'errors' but as 'differences'
- exclude ext3's .journal files from backup (yes, this time I really do)
- '--my-kernel SUCKS' has been replaced with '--my-kernel FAILSAFE'
- softlink mondo-restore to /usr/bin/ before calling Mindi, so that Mindi can pick up mondo-restore and its depdendencies easily
- copy mondo-restore to Mondo's temp dir before calling Mindi
- don't try to compress MP3's, MPG's, WMV's or RA's
- cleaned up mondo-newt.c; alphabetized the subroutines; moved some tools from there to mondo-tools.c
- mondo-tarme and mondo-restore are now compiled as dynamic executables; I have amended install.sh and mondo-1.31.spec accordingly
- now make boot/data floppies at end of backup, not beginning
- backup in alphabetical order now, not reverse-alpha
- if Compare Mode reports changed files /var/* and /etc/mtab only then tell the user their archives are good despite the differneces
- cut back on excessively verbose logging at backup-time
- when vacuum-packing a partition, describe it as "(max size)", not "(0 MB)"
- if swap is already mounted, don't abort: just say, 'swap already mounted'
- when unmounting all devices, don't try to unmount something if it's not even mounted; if it's not mounted, say so but don't try to unmount it: you'll just end up looking very silly :)

v1.30 (2001-11-28)
- I have reorganized the C code, sorted the subroutines alphabetically, and re-jigged Mondo's installation routines (inc. the RPM spec file) to reflect the changes
- check for mondo-restore's presence; if absent then abort & ask user to check to see if Mondo was installed properly
- always exclude /var/log/pacct from backup
- optimal set size is now 24MB
- install.sh will abort w/error if compilation of mondo-* fails
- after creating the mountlist, put a copy in Mondo's tmp directory
- each ext3 filesystem has a .journal file in its base directory; Mondo will now exclude each of these journal files automatically
- use the archived copy of LILO, not the copy from the restore-time ramdisk, to configure the MBR
- size_of_file() now returns long long, not long
- find mondo-archive and set MONDO_PATH accordingly
- scratchdir is /home/mondo.scratch by default
- at backup-time, run mondo-restore in test mode to make sure that the executable is sane & will run OK at restore-time

v1.19 (2001-11-14)
- tested on Linux-Mandrake 8.0 and Red Hat 7.2; backup,wipe,restore went OK
- fixed a bug in is_this_device_mounted()
- at restore-time, always check for presence of decompressor; abort if notfound
- run 'chmod -r 1777 /mnt/RESTORING/tmp' after restoring
- fixed bugs in Compare Mode:- - missing else{} - erroneous 'cannot add archive' error; res+=retval should have read retval+=res (Tony Kim)
- use 'umount /mnt/cdrom' instead of 'umount /dev/cdrom', to make it compatible with busybox's umount command
- fixed bug in mondo-archive which stopped Mondo from pausing to retry if the CD/ISO fails the verification phase
- modified compare_all_tarballs() in mondo-restore.c
- if running interactively then offer to modify fstab and lilo.conf if user says s/he has modified the mountlist
- if mondo-tarme segfaults (as it does, on a _very_ few systems) then Mondo picks up on the fact & reports it
- when restoring, create /mnt/RESTORING/tmp before _and_ after restoring data, just in case it is necessary; also set permissions okay
- C code is now compiled 'O0' (without optimizations)
- each CD's slices were being listed to screen; now, piped to /dev/null

v1.18 (2001-10-28)
- changed minor error in documentation (mondo-archive's --help output)
- improved Mondo's compare phase for tape users

v1.17 (2001-10-20)
- the deprecated scripts now work with LZO
- if mondo-restore cannot mount all devices, it will _unmount_ whatever it did mount, before it returns an error
- works with Red Hat 6.2 and 2.2.19 kernel
- cosmetic change to output (no more 'burning first/last CD' msgs)
- abort if user uses '--use-lzo' but doesn't install LZO(P) first
- changed --differential's \( and \) to ( and ) <-- thanks, Michael Moellney)
- added Marcus Oberhumer's LZO to Mindi and Mondo; use '--use-lzo' switch to activate this groovy new compression algorithm; it is not as efficient as bzip2 but it is can take up to 50 percent less time than bzip2 to compress data
- incorporated Bruno Cornec's "--cd-recovery" patch
- at restore-time, set biggiefiles to +x
- set optimal fileset size to 16MB (was 8MB)
- don't report non-existent differences/errors between archives and filesystem
- fixed bug in --differential switch (Michael Moellney)
- scripts will no longer function unless gawk and printf are included in Mindi's deplist.txt; add them if you want to use the scripts

v1.16 (2001-10-10)
- default scratchdir is `pwd`/mondo.scratch.$$ (was mondo.scratch)
- when asking user to send me a log file, warn them that the log file may contain information which they do not want me to see but point out that I cannot help much unless I have a copy of their log file
- when comparing to or restoring from tape, only update the progree form if/when I've just restored files; otherwise, I would screw up the time est.s
- increase afio's block count from 256 to 1024 when restoring from tape
- plays nicely with devfs-enabled kernels and distros
- when restoring or comparing, track progress by the archive# (N out of M), not by the file#; the former is more reliable and useful than the latter
- has been tested successfully with the following distros - Linux-Mandrake 8.1 and its 2.4.8, devfs-enabled stock kernel --- tape / CDR - Red Hat 7.1 and its 2.4.2 stock kernel --- tape / CDR
- tape streamers are now supported; use the '--write-tapes <dev> <sizeMB>' switch, e.g. --write-tapes /dev/st0 4096
- LVM support is stabilizing
- when mounting/unmounting partitions to be restored, don't forget to mount/unmount the swap partitions
- when zeroing a drive, use plain old C fopen/fputc/fclose, not 'dd'
- after restoring data and running LILO, unmount (as usual) and then run label-partitions-as-necessary, to set the ext2fs LABELs if it is appropriate
- fixed bugs in selective restoration scripts and executable
- fixed silly bug in hack-lilo; bug was triggered when I moved to Mandrake 8.1; bug caused '/dev/fd0' entry in lilo.conf to become corrupted
- if user tries to make a bootable rescue CD with the '--no-bkpath' switch then politely direct them to Mindi :-)

v1.15 (2001-09-28)
- serialized the call to mondo-filelistchop.c; helps to improve visual feedback (yeah, sounds weird but it's true)
- the switches --differential and --exclude-paths should play nicely now
- improved the logging a bit, esp. when ejecting or unmounting CD's
- improved the visual feedback (specifically, the bar and percentage figures indicating time spent & remaining)
- experimental LVM support
- fixed 'cannot eject CD' bug, which was caused by busybox's sync & umount
- fixed mount-me to allow for mountlists with >1 spaces between columns
- fixed documentation; param is --my-kernel <path>, not kernel-path <path>
- fail if user runs mondo-archive _from CD_; this is for the user's protection
- fixed silly bug in mount-me (a crucial line was disabled)
- working on stablilo-me, hack-lilo and hack-fstab to make sure they work with the new, busybox-based Mindi v0.41
- Mindi v0.41 is very different from v0.40, internally anyway; so, I had to do a lot of testing to make sure Mondo would play nicely with the new Mindi

v1.14 (2001-09-18)
- if verify is enabled then verify each CD/ISO after writing it
- fixed a quasi-bug in mondo/mount-me; this script used 'sort +1' which is not supported by busybox; I've changed it to just plain old 'sort'
- Mondo now tells Mindi whether or not to use its stock kernel
- fixed bug in 'biggify-me' script; now, checksums will be verified
- fixed bug in checksum comparison code (mondo-restore.c)
- reimplemented '--verify' switch; now, user can verify ISO's or CD's against the live filesystem, just for 'belt and braces' emotional security
- improved the error-reporting at restore-time (if tarball cannot be accessed)
- if user does not specify CD-R(W) drive's speed or device then Mondo will try to locate the drive and will assume 4x speed
- user may now type 'edit-mountlist' after booting, if they want to edit the mountlist without risking accidentally wiping their hard disks
- fixed a few silly typos in the error messages in mondo-tarme
- updated the FAQ
- added code to verify ISO images
- used 'blank=fast' instead of '-blank fast' for backward-compatibility with older versions of cdrecord
- if nonzero value returned by Mondo, then Mondo creates a mondo.err.$$.tgz tarball containing log files & stuff, which it tells the user to e-mail me
- when debugging, don't pause before running mondo-tarme; just run it
- automatically exclude any file including '/vmmhiber.w9x' in its pathname
- added Minix support (although I doubt anyone needs it)
- ported mondo-tarme to C - prettier interface at run-time (backup), giving better feedback - obviates a mysterious, intermittent bug in bash itself - shows ' percent done' when burning CD
- afio now has a 12MB FIFO buffer (was 16MB)
- cdrecord now has a 20MB FIFO buffer (was 24MB)
- wipe [CD]/usr/share/mondo, as well as floppy images, if CD #2 or later
- up to 19 CD's may be created now
- fixed the 'stderr.txt not found' loop error in mondo-tarme.c
- fixed the weird 'segfault on finish() after archiving' bug
- modularized the install.sh and mondo-1.14-x.i386.rpm compilation sections

v1.13 (2001-09-01)
- fixed some compiler warnings in mondo-newt.c; rearranged some code
- mondo-tarme now uses -M 16m -t 4k in its call to afio, to improve performance
- fixed mondo-restore.c's mkreiserfs call; ditto, prep-me's mkreiserfs call
- fixed mondo-restore.c's compare_a_biggiefile() subroutine, which would generate erroneous error messages
- fixed mondo-archive.c's restore_a_biggiefile() and restore_all_biggiefiles() subroutines; I can't get them to break but others can, so I've streamlined the code to make them easier to debug and in theory more stable too
- fixed 'hack-fstab' to make sure that non-LABELed partitions are correctly moved/changed, etc.
- fixed the 'space in big filename' bug (I think)
- make Interactive Mode sort the mountlist (by partition size) before creating the dirs and mounting the partitions to them
- fixed a slew of bugs related to Red Hat's LABEL= extensions
- cleaned up mondo-restore.c and mondo-newt.c; replaced lots of arbitrary limits and lengths with a small number of #define's
- added some sample RAID0/1/5 raidtab (config) files to restore-scripts.tgz, which will be restored to the ramdisk's /etc dir when the user boots from the CD; this will only take up an extra 50K or so & will help any user who is moving from non-RAID to RAID
- changed FIFO size to 20MB
- only use the VFAT kludge on /dev/hda1 or /dev/sda1; otherwise, even if the partition type is VFAT, do a regular mkfs.vfat
- if mkfs.vfat doesn't exist, use mkfs.dos
- only try to add 'LABEL=' to ext2 and ext3 partitions
- moved a bunch of scripts from Mindi's rootfs.tgz to our restore-scripts.tgz
- fixed bugs in mondo-restore.c, which would sometimes just sit there when trying to compare or restore big files that were spread across CD's
- Interactive Mode goes straight to 'mondo-restore --interactive' now, i.e.  the user doesn't have to choose Interactive once at boot and once within mondo-restore
- better post-run clean-up
- improved mondo-restore.c's error-reporting a little bit
- stablilo-me (the script) now supports Red Hat's "LABEL=" extensions to /etc/fstab, via the script, 'label-partitions-as-necessary'
- added a user-friendly mountlist editor to mondo-restore.c
- added lots of sanity-checking to mountlist editor

v1.12 (2001-08-18)
- changed cdrecord's FIFO size to 8MB
- removed -pad and -sort from the call to mkisofs
- amended the .spec file to be saner when building RPM's
- archives are named '.afio.bz2' instead of '.tar.bz2'
- mondo-archive, mondo-tarme, mondo-restore.c and the DEPRECATED scripts have been amended accordingly
- should be able to create up to 20 CD-R's per backup set now
- moved a line within prep-me that was in the wrong place (thanks, Fran Boon!)
- runs 'df -m' and saves it to a text file 'df.txt' on the CD
- added 10-second delay before mondo-restore's Nuke Mode, to let the user abort
- really fixed the '/mnt/RESTORING/tmp' permissions bug (thanks, Ang Tan!)
- sometimes, bash gets all screwed up & won't let the user type 'continue' when Mondo asks them to; if that happens, Mondo will detect it & use a different kind of mondo-askme; the new mondo-askme will check every 10 minutes for a blank CD; if it's there, then the burn continues
- abort if isodir or scratchdir is a softlink
- replaced mondo-askme with a good shell script, to work around flaws in bash and/or kernel (don't know which)
- added a failsafe kernel to Mindi, which means you don't have to make sure your kernel is suitable for a boot disk; you can just use Mindi's instead
- make+chop filelist _after_ calling Mindi
- updated the FAQ

v1.10 (2001-08-12)
- changed cdrecord's FIFO size back to 4MB
- added -pad -sort to the call to mkisofs
- stop saying, "N files differ so far" after comparing each tarball
- updated the FAQ, to remind users that they can boot from floppy images if their kernel does not have the right support of CD-ROM's, filesystems, etc.
- erroneous error-reporting by /mondo/biggify-me; fixed (David Granz)
- don't estimate the time remaining unless >20 sets processed already
- default set size (uncompressed) is now 8MB (was 12MB); when 8MB, seems to run more smoothly & a little quicker, too, at restore-time
- chmod 1777 /mnt/RESTORING/tmp after restoring/creating /tmp
- dropped mondo-askme.c; using regular 'read' instead
- mondo-restore.c uses newt instead of ncurses; much prettier that way
- cdrecord now uses a 16MB FIFO buffer (was 8MB)
- fixed floating point error in mondo-restore (when showing progress)
- when mondo-restore is called without params (e.g. by Interactive Mode), it lets the user choose between nuke, interactive or compare (or abort)
- updated the FAQ
- working on Cuckoo Mode...

v1.09 (2001-08-02)
- default compression level is now 3 (was 2)
- retry/fail/abort loop bug fixed
- calls mindi with "--custom $TMP $scratchdir/images" to force mindi to use my temp dir and to put the images in my 'images' folder

v1.08 (2001-07-28)
- offer to Retry/Fail/Abort if an error occurs when Mondo tries to burn a CD-R
- warn if kernel is 2.4.[0-5] (could have buggy loopfs code)
- tested with RAID-5 --- works fine :-)

v1.07 (2001-07-22)
- fixed cosmetic mistake in an error msg in mondo-tarme ('continue'-related)
- hack-fstab now uses "defaults 0 0" instead of "default 1 3" when making a new entry in /etc/fstab
- /mondo/restore-me always makes /mnt/RESTORING/tmp; so does mondo-restore.c
- cosmetic changes to mondo-restore.c's screen output
- RAID-related enhancements to mondo-restore.c - RAID bkp/restore appears to be stable - it is possible to move from non-RAID to RAID by backing up, wiping, creating /etc/raidtab, modifying /tmp/mountlist.txt and then restoring - mondo-restore.c works well - the only weakness is that the kernel's messages are written to the current console, not to a separate console... HELP? :-)
- updated README (esp. FAQ) and TODO
- tested with Linux 2.4.7; works fine
- mondo-1.07.spec and install.sh compile every C program with -lncurses, just in case some programs (besides mondo-restore.c) need the NCURSES library
- mondo-restore.c is now compiled statically

v1.06 (2001-07-19)
- now software-RAID compatible
- install.sh only compiles mondo-restore.c once now
- if scratchdir or isodir contain more than one path (each), abort
- mondo-restore.c creates dummy partitions if the user starts the official etc/fstab table at /dev/hda7 or something; so, partitioning should work, even if the mountlist has some gaps
- for each /dev/md* device in the mountlist, run raidstop before mkraid

v1.05 (2001-07-16)
- patch from DoJ to make install.sh compile with -O2, not -O
- cosmetic changes to the biggiefile-slicing code
- fixed install.sh

v1.04 (2001-07-15)
- make-me-bootable only "boot-makes" each partition ONCE now
- cosmetic changes to mondo-restore's logfile output
- mondo-restore.c makes /mnt/RESTORING/tmp if necessary
- should be able to cope with Red Hat's "LABEL=" messages in /etc/fstab

v1.03 (2001-07-14)
- looks for /etc/lilo.conf; aborts if it cannot locate it
- abort if burning CD's & verify level>=2 (must be 1 or 0 if burning CD's)
- catch errors in MakeIsoFS, if any
- added 'mondo-restore.c'
	- C program, to replace the old restore scripts
	- Mindi will incorporate it in the data disks, if it can find Mondo - Mindi will also incorporate the old restore scripts (from Mondo) just in case the new C program doesn't work
	- calls the script, 'stablilo-me' to run LILO if desired
- added 'restore-scripts.tgz', which contains the /mondo scripts that used to live in Mindi; now, Mindi grabs them from here if necessary
- cleared up Mode-related scripts & the executable to replace them
- if mkisofs fails, ABORT, don't just warn
- added '--differential' option, to backup the files changed during the last N days (N specified by user)

v1.02 (2001-07-07)
- retract the CD tray after asking user to enter 'continue' (PauseAndAskForCDR)
- uses C program instead of bash loop for PauseAndAskForCDR; some bash versions go into an infinite loop for no reason; hopefully, outsourcing to C will help
- when slicing, indicate progress ("N slices...")
- when told to '--burn-cds', Mondo pipes mkisofs's output to cdrecord, instead of saving the ISO file to disk first; this change will save time and space (not in the Star Trek sense, however *smile*)
- default set size (native) is now 12MB
- copy /usr/share/mondo to correct directory within CD
- all calls to gawk have been replaced with calls to awk
- RPM and SRPM published
- delete $TMP at end; don't just delete $TMP/*
- can accept multiple parameters in the '--bkpath' switch

v1.00 (2001-07-04)
- thanks to recent changes to Mindi, Mondo is now compatible with the filesystem formats JFS, ext3, ReiserFS, XFS and ext2 (if your own kernel is)
- CDs [2-N] do not have boot floppy images on them; only CD#1 does (although CDs [2-N] do have the El Torito boot image, just in case...)
- modified the --burn-cds switch; now it takes 3rd param, 'cdrw' (optional) to let you wipe and rewrite CDRWs instead of wasting CDRs ;-)
- removed that PID thing; doesn't work; please don't run Mondo twice at once :)
- removed that "filenames contain '|'" error & associated problems
- got rid of 'UNSAFE' warning/shortcut
- removed --xerox-dev, --include-tarball, --skip-tildes, --ide-opt, --use-bzip2
- mondo-archive doesn't make/hack/edit mountlist anymore; that's Mindi's job
- uses Mindi Linux to make boot disks & data disks based on your distro
- boot&data stuff goes in $scratchdir/images now
- bzip2 is used by default to compress archives
- don't make MD5 checksums if verify_level==0
- when archiving, make N.tar.bz2 and cklist.txt (tarball+checksums) in parallel
- at end of mondo-archive, remove scratchdir and TMP completely IF they were created by Mondo (e.g. /home/mondo.scratch or /home/tmp.mondo.12345)
- fill CD/image up to 1MB less than its max size; was being filled up to about 8MB less than its max size, which wasted 8-10MB of storage space per disk

v0.99 (2001-03-15)
- /proc and /tmp removed --- i.e. added to exclude list :)
- Mondo now uses 2.4-series kernel and modules (Bruno Cornec)
- minor typos fixed (Bruno Cornec)
- older, restore-related fixes merged w/Bruce's work (Maciej Kulasa)
- better RPM spec file (Bruno Cornec)
- incorporated Mondo v0.977's restore scripts' bugfixes (Maciej Kulasa)

v0.981 (2001-03-06)
- put 'dd' in coolstuff.tgz (Art Wells)

v0.98 (2001-02-28)
- INSTALL script renamed to install.sh
- tarball cleaned up and re-tarred (Art Wells)
- trailing CR/LF's cleaned from scripts (Art Wells)
- work is underway to make Mondo compatible with the Linux kernel's 2.4 series

v0.977 (2001-02-26)
- based on v0.976
- missing subs and silly typos fixed in restore scripts (Maciej Kulasa)
- fstab files containing NFS mounts are handled properly (Petre Scheie)
- Mondo is being actively developed again (yippee!)

v0.976 (2000-09-01)
- technical changes - 12MB ramdisk - repackaged: now, Mondo comes in big tarball/RPM with all overhead-files - each Mondo CD has a 15MB administrative overhead; used to be 50-60MB - definitely 386-compatible now (RH 6.2 binaries) - Linux-Mandrake 7.1 (2.2.16) kernel w/ReiserFS & Supermount - modules.conf / conf.modules support (whichever you've got) - user may include their own copies of modules, if Mondo doesn't come with the requisite modules already
- extra facilities - ReiserFS support - '--load-modules <foo> <bar> ...' will allow you to force Mondo to load key modules at boot-time, e.g. aic7xxx for SCSI-only users
- bugfixes - path-exclusion code (mondo-backup) - bogus 'flaws=1' message has been eradicated - CDRW-finding code is now much better at finding the CDRW correctly - dummy burn mode is working again - fixed security hole (thanks, Matija); now, user will be warned if Mondo is configured to execute /tmp/mondo-tarme - changed lots of 'grep " $string "' to 'grep -w "$string"' (thanks, Matija)

v0.975 (2000-07-03)
- made mondo-tarme use 'ask-me-a-question' to pause for new, blank CD-Rs
- don't deeply search isodir for ISO files to wipe: maxdepth should be 1
- 386-compatible kernel and modules (should be, anyway...)
- applied Doug Nordwall's calc-disk-size patch to fix SCSI hdd size calc'n bug
- applied Michael Ralph Pape's SCSI (2nd floppy) patch
- removed devdump from overhead-list
- mkisofs no longer called with '-quiet' switch
- changed '--burn-cds' format: now it's --burn-cds <speed> (<device>)
- added '-L' to LILO's call, so that >8GB hard disks overcome 1024-blk limit
- mondo-compare runs check-mountlist-sanity before mounting partitions
- ramdisk is now 14MB

v0.972 (2000-06-16)
- auto-archive, mondo-archive and mondo-tarme updated to make them more friendly towards mult-disk sets
- if multiple CDRW drives, user is asked which mondo-archive should use

v0.971 (2000-06-14)
- auto-archive now passes CD size to mondo-archive
- mondo-tarme, in conjunction with auto-archive, now handles CDRW boot/burn sharing much better than before

v0.970 (2000-06-10)
- kernel now creates 12MB ramdrive (was 16MB)
- lots of silly bugs & overhead problems fixed; 2nd floppy closer to working
- restore scripts all log to /var/log/mondo-restore.log
- auto-archive:- - offers Low, Medium or High compression - no longer needs a spare hard drive for scratch space; uses loopfs on existing hard drive (if possible) instead - handles weird (multi-CDROM) PCs more gracefully now - handles PCs with CDRW but without CDROM more gracefully now - deletes each ISO after burning it to a CD-R (if it _is_ burning them) - asks if PC is old & crappy; if it is, IDE optimizations are disabled at backup-time and restore-time - lets user use CDRW for booting _and_ burning, thanks to reroute-softlinks
- selective restore is finally fixed
- nicer help screens on boot floppy

v0.965 (2000-06-03)
- 2MB of space left empty at end of every CD (e.g. 650MB is only 648MB full)
- Suzhe & Lonius's SmartBootManager (sbminst) is used instead of Win98's MBR
- Mondo may now resize Windows-only backups when restoring
- silly bugs in prep-me... fixed

v0.964 (2000-06-02)
- VFAT partitions >8GB handled OK now
- 2nd floppy (optionally) created for SCSI users <--- not working yet
- better calc-disk-size algorithm (thanks, Doug Nordwall)
- Mondo can now backup and restore Windows-only PCs! :-)
- silly prep-me and format-and-kludge-vfat bugs fixed
- 'resize hack' retitled as 'vacuum-pack'

v0.963 (2000-05-31)
- ISO images are no longer padded
- all currently-loaded modules are backed up to custom hboot.img & installed at restore-time before CD is accessed
- '--burn-cd <speed>' switch added
- '--no-opt' switch added; use it in the call to mondo-archive if you don't want IDE optimization when restoring
- lots of work done on auto-archive
- mondo-extras-1.5 created; excludes mondo-zfile but includes hlib.tar.bz2
- boot floppy image now includes kernel w/lots of SCSI stuff
- slice* deleted (WipeArchives); was 'slices*' (bug!)
- restore scripts all use 'lastbit-me' to find the 'X' part of '/dev/X' device; this will make it easier to port Mondo to kernel 2.4.x
- I cannot make SCSI-based CDROMs boot from Mondo CDs properly... but SCSI hard drives and ZIP drives should be handled ok from now on
- with a little coaxing, Mondo will backup Windows-only PCs (as well as Lin/Win and Linux-only PCs)

v0.962 (2000-05-25)
- silly bug in mondo-checksum fixed
- stale tmp dirs are now definitely deleted (bug fixed)
- "Job is  percent d complete. hh:ss to go." --- much better 'progress' string
- 'buffer' is gone again :) thank goodness
- only 1st ISO is padded; the rest aren't.
- working on implementing an easy 'cdrecord' shortcut-call-thingy
- mondo-archive doesn't try to delete loopfs unless it exists
- mondo-restore's "hack-softlinks" - silly bug ($1/ missing) fixed
- boot floppy image now includes mkdir and rmdir
- user may specify temp directory using '--tempdir <path>'
- mondo-archive now includes a copy of 'buffer' for future use
- Mondo will now archive and restore Linux AND LinWin systems ok. W00H00! :-)

v0.961 (2000-05-23)
- mondo-checksum ignores files <2k in length
- default compression level is 4
- default verify level is 2
- files <3k in size aren't compressed
- filelist no longer includes bashbug, dosfsck or dir
- bs-me is disabled in mondo-restore
- fixed bug in 'hack-fstab' which stopped processing fstab if blank line found

v0.960 (2000-05-22)
- mondo-vfat-1.0 package released, to provide kludging for VFAT bootables
- logfile now saved at /var/log/mondo-archive.log (not `pwd`/mondo-archive.log)
- pid registered/checked _after_ command line processed... so you can do --help without being shouted at ;)
- restore-me broken into 2 scripts: untar-me and biggify-me
- restore-subroutine-me now renamed untar-subroutine-me
- bzip2 decompression should work again ;) ... a missing '-Z' was added to the afio call, and the usr/lib/libbz* libraries are now included on CD ISOs
- fixed hack-lilo to ignore blank lines
- really ugly boot kludge has been implemented, using embleer files to make newly-formatted VFAT partitions bootable

=== Morgen 2.1.6

* Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where certain CalDAV accounts could not be connected
- Fixed a bug causing recurring events to be displayed on the wrong day in some timezones
- Fixed a problem causing the event detail widget to become unresponsive in some edge cases
- Fixed an issue causing the wrong organizer to be set when importing external invitations into Google Calendar; now, Morgen also disallows importing multiple times the same event
- Fixed the colored calendar indicator in the Save button to show the correct calendar color
- Fixed an issue preventing switching recurrent events to a different calendar

* Improvements
- Added a loading indicator in the event detail widget to indicate that an event is being updated
- Prevent entering the alpha channel when defining custom calendar colors, because this is not supported
- Event colors in dark mode have been slightly adjusted to be less strong
- Add throttle on the refresh calendars operation, to avoid lag on the calendar view when coming into focus
- Restore the previous status of the sidebar when the app is launched
- Ensure that existing events cannot be imported as duplicates

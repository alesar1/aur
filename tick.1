.TH TICK "1" "May 2018" "Tick 2.2.0" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
Tick - Command line stock and cryptocurrency portfolio tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
tick COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Create your portfolio by "add"-ing your current holdings. Then, use the command "check" to see information about your
holdings. You may also see information about securities that you may not own with commands "info" and "graph".

.SS
Portfolio:

.TP
[add/rm/set] [symbol/crypto_id/USD$] [quantity of shares] [USD spent/SharePriceEA]
Either adds, removes, or sets the amount of the given stock with respect to the given values. The parameter "add" will add
your input to the current portfolio, "rm" will subtract from your current portfolio, and "set" will set your portfolio to
the input, discarding any existing data about that security. Trading fees should be factored into "USD SPENT". As an exception,
cryptocurrencies must be specified by their name (e.g. "ripple", instead of "xrp"), due to duplicate tickers in both the
US stock market and the cryptocurrency market. You may also input as "usd$" for US Dollars. This is helpful for keeping
track of how much money is unallocated in your brokerage account. Typically, your initial amount of USD can be added as
"tick add USD$ [amount] [amount]", where [amount] is the same number. When you are paid dividends or capital gains that
are not reinvested into a specific security, you should update your portfolio with "tick add USD$ [dividend/capital gain amount] 0".
You may also specify the share price instead of the total amount you spent by appending "ea" to the end of the share price.

.TP
[check]
Prints information about all of your current holdings and a grand total in an NCurses window. By default, your holdings
will be sorted alphabetically. You may press the left and right arrow keys to change the sort category. Press "q" to
exit the window.

.TP
[check] [symbol/crypto_id/USD$]
Prints information about a specific security in your portfolio.

.TP
[encrypt/decrypt]
Encrypts or decrypts your portfolio using the RC4 algorithm. Password must be 32 characters or less.

.SS
Security Information:

.TP
[info] [symbol]
Prints information on the given security. This includes company name, current and historical price, dividends, market cap,
and volume.

.TP
[graph] [symbol]
Prints a graph of the historic price of the given security. Cryptocurrencies aren't supported yet, due to API constraints.
You may press the UP arrow key to zoom in, the DOWN arrow key to zoom out, the LEFT arrow to pan left, the RIGHT arrow
to pan right, or the letter "q" to quit.

.TP
[cmp] [symbol] [symbol]
Same functionality to "graph", but is intended for comparing two securities. The command takes two symbols as
arguments. Both graphs will be displayed.

.TP
[news] [symbol]
Prints information on the top three news articles in the past 14 days. The article titles, sources, authors, dates, and URLs
will be displayed. If you would like to use a space in your search, you must either use an underscore instead of the space or wrap
your phrase in double quotes. Technically, the input may be something completely unrelated to investing. This may be amended
in the future.

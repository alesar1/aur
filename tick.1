.TH TICK "1" "March 2018" "Tick 1.10.0" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
Tick - Command line stock and cryptocurrency portfolio tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
tick COMMAND [ARGUMENTS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Create your portfolio by adding your current holdings. You can see information about your holdings with the command "check".
You may also see information about securities that you may not own with commands "info" and "news".

.SS
Portfolio:

.TP
[add/rm/set] [symbol/crypto_id/USD$] [quantity of shares] [USD spent/SharePriceEA]
Either adds, removes, or sets the amount of the given stock with respect to the given values. The parameter "add" will add
your input to the current portfolio, "rm" will subtract from your current portfolio, and "set" will set your portfolio to
the input, discarding any existing data about that security. Trading fees should be factored into "USD SPENT". As an exception,
cryptocurrencies must be specified by their name (e.g. "ripple", instead of "xrp"), due to duplicate tickers in both the
US stock market and the cryptocurrency market. You may also input as "usd$" for US Dollars. This is helpful for keeping
track of how much money is unallocated in your brokerage account. Typically, your initial amount of USD can be added as
"tick add USD$ [amount] [amount]", where [amount] is the same number. When you are paid dividends or capital gains that
are not reinvested into a specific security, you should update your portfolio with "tick add USD$ [dividend/capital gain amount] 0".
You may also specify the share price instead of the total amount you spent by appending "ea" to the end of the share price.

.TP
[check] [currency name/crypto_id/all]
Prints information about your current portfolio holdings. Either a symbol or the keyword 'all' can be used. The keyword "all"
will print information about all your current holdings, as well as a grand total. Running only 'tick check' will do the same
thing as 'tick check all'.

.TP
[encrypt/decrypt]
Encrypts or decrypts your portfolio using the RC4 algorithm. Password must be 32 characters or less.

.SS
Security Information:

.TP
[info] [symbol]
Prints information on the given security. This includes company name, current and historical price, dividends, market cap,
and volume.

.TP
[news] [symbol]
Prints information on the top three news articles in the past 14 days. The article titles, sources, authors, dates, and URLs
will be displayed. If you would like to use a space in your search, you must either use an underscore instead of the space or wrap
your phrase in double quotes. Technically, the input may be something completely unrelated to investing. This may be amended
in the future.

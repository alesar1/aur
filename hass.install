		This package installs a hass.service and a hass-update.service to manage the Home Assistant installation.
		You can ( and should ) configure the parameters for native modules compilation at /etc/hass.env.
		Auto update and installation of Home Assistant is handled before service launch/restart, it may take a while, especially the first time.

# Here's the issue:
#
# Due to filesystem permission problems, a normal user is unable to play
# Clone Hero when it's just installed into /opt like normal. The game is
# unable to write to that folder, so nothing works properly. The only
# way to get the game to work is to run everything like it exists in the
# user's home folder. Unfortunately, symlinks aren't enough.
#
# We copy over all the needed files from /opt to the user's home
# directory, if we find the copy in /opt to be newer than the one the
# user already has. This way, they get new copies of the executable and
# game data whenever there's a new version. Unfortunately, this does
# mean that we have to touch $HOME, and this is an extremely ugly hack.


# I am the second maintainer of this package, and I concur;
# this hack is horrible. I do offer my thanks though to the original
# maintainer; debugging this must have been a pain in the ass.

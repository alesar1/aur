* #573 Add file upload to the navigation bar file_cabinet
  File sizes are very restrictive at this point due to the fact that encryption/decryption is made in the browser and that the storage is memory. Use this feature for certificate/keys and other things where you need to quickly drag and drop.

* #550 Set Common Security Headers.
  Big thanks to @grobie!

* #566 Added the option to manually set a decryption key for secrets.
  Thanks @jfenske89!

### Fix

* Fix rendering in indented blocks (fixes #31) [Grzegorz Adamiak]

  It fixes [issue][31] with rendering indented fenced blocks. They were
  rendered only when put at beginning of the line. To illustrate, this
  block was processed correctly

      ```plantuml
      A --> B : I am processed
      ```

  while a block nested under a list item (indented) was not processed

        * A list item with nested block

          ```plantuml
          A --> B : I am not processed
          ```

  [31]: https://github.com/mikitex70/plantuml-markdown/issues/31

  With this patch the block is converted into image and correctly put in
  the document tree allowing for images nested in other block elements,
  e.g. list items.

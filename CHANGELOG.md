##[1.11.0] What's new in version 1.11.0

### New

* Added installer build for Windows ARM64
* Added "Position when adding songs to list" setting with options for "Top" and
"Bottom" of the list

### Optimization

* Server connection attempts
* Link compatibility of opening song list by MG source

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue with searching MG source

### Removed

* Since "WY source" no longer has the option to sort by "latest", we've removed
the respective button in WY source song lists

### Changes

* (Verbatim) If you want to want to reverse the order of songs in your list,
you can click the last song in the list while holding shift key, then click the
first song in the list to complete the reverse order, then right click any song
in the list, choose adjust order in the popup menu, enter 1 in the popup box and
OK to reverse the order list.

* If you want to revert to the original behavior, you can change the "Add Songs
to List" setting

### Other

* Update to Electron 13.1.7

Map Overlays

Most outline map overlays included in G.Projector are based on the Micro World Data Bank II (MWDB II) dataset, originally created by Fred Pospeschil and Antonio Rivera. Note that G.Projector uses outline data dated 2011 as available for download from Pospeschil's website with minor modifications. Although some national borders have since changed, the border outlines included in G.Projector may not reflect all such changes.

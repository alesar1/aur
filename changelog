What's new in version 1.0.7:
	- now elements too can have aliases.
	- now if syntax file is not found at specified location,
	  try to see if it is already present in doc dir (es.
	  /usr/share/doc/guish/syntaxes/...).
	- added command to bypass window manager (see bypasswm).
	- added new special form when using 'define' command, es "var = 2"
	  or "var define 2".
	- added additional aliases to commands.
	- minor addition on webpage.

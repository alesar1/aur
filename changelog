Badwolf 1.2.0 release! — 2021-10-02

Highlights
==========

Additions
---------
- Middle clicking on a tab now closes it
- Translations: Vietnamese

Changes
-------
- This release introduces a ./configure script, it isn't autotools-like,
  it takes environment variables as configuration overrides and writes
  the results to config.mk
- Drop usage of libsoup URI parser in favor of GLib's GUri

Fixes
-----
- webkit2gtk-4.1 (WebKit GTK+3.0 port with libsoup3) compatibility
- WebKitGTK 2.34.0+, requiring GApplication initialization
- Manpage: Some tags were off, apparently leading to broken formatting
- crashes: download stop icon, about dialog

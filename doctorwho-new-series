the works of Ludwig van Beethoven. And one day he thinks, "What's the point of 
having a time machine if you don't get to meet your heroes?" So off he goes to 
18th-century Germany. But he can't find Beethoven anywhere. No-one's heard of 
him, not even his family have any idea who the time traveller is talking about. 
Beethoven literally doesn't exist. (This didn't happen, by the way. I've met 
Beethoven. Nice chap. Very intense. Loved an arm-wrestle. No, this is called 
"The Bootstrap Paradox". Google it.) The time traveller panics, he can't bear 
the thought of a world without the music of Beethoven. Luckily he'd brought all 
his Beethoven sheet music for Ludwig to sign. So he copies out all the 
concertos and the symphonies... and he gets them published. He becomes 
Beethoven. And history continues with barely a feather ruffled. But my question 
is this. Who put those notes and phrases together? Who really composed 
Beethoven's 5th?"

than you could ever imagine, and when I close my eyes... I hear more screams 
than anyone could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all

"So you want me to tell you a story? The Brothers Grimm. Lovely fellows. 
They're on my darts team. According to them, there's this emperor, and he asks 
this shepherd's boy, "How many seconds in eternity?" And the shepherd's boy 
says, "There's this mountain of pure diamond. It takes an hour to climb it and 
an hour to go around it! And every hundred years a little bird comes and 
sharpens its beak on the diamond mountain. And when the entire mountain is 
chiseled away, the first... second... of eternity... will have passed!" You may 
think that's a hell of a long time! Personally... Personally, I think that's a 
hell of a bird."

 — Twelfth Doctor: There have been many attempts to conquer the Earth. I've 
lost count. Not one of them has succeeded. Not a single one. They all lost and 
burned and ran. That's who I am.

"The end of your life has already begun. There is a last place you will ever 
go, a last door you will ever walk through, a last sight you will ever see, and 
every step you ever take is moving you closer. The end of the world is a 
billion billion tiny moments, and somewhere, unnoticed, in silence or in 
darkness, it has already begun."

"Hey! I'm going to be dead in a few hours, so before I go, let's have this out, 
you and me, once and for all. Winning? Is that what you think it's about? I'm 
not trying to win. I'm not doing this because I want to beat someone, or 
because I hate someone, or because, because I want to blame someone. It's not 
because it's fun and God knows it's not because it's easy. It's not even 
because it works, because it hardly ever does. I do what I do, because it's 
right! Because it's decent! And above all, it's kind. It's just that. Just 
kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of 
them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe 
there's no point in any of this at all, but it's the best I can do, so I'm 
going to do it. And I will stand here doing it till it kills me. You're going 
to die too, some day. How will that be? Have you thought about it? What would 
you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand, is where I fall. Stand 
with me. These people are terrified. Maybe we can help, a little. Why not, just 
at the end, just be kind?"

"Oh, there it is. Silly old universe. The more I save it the more it needs 
saving. It's a treadmill. [the TARDIS makes argumentative noises; the Doctor 
sighs heavily] Yes, yes, I know they'll get it all wrong without me. [the 
TARDIS makes noises in agreement] Well, I suppose... one more lifetime won't 
kill anyone... Well, except me. You wait a moment, Doctor! Let's get it right. 
I've got a few things to say to you. Basic stuff first. Never be cruel, never 
be cowardly. And never, ever eat pears! Remember, hate is always foolish... and 
love, is always wise. [sighs wearily] Always try, to be nice and never fail to 
be kind. Oh, and... and you mustn't tell anyone your name. No-one would 
understand it anyway. Except... [gasps and collapses to the floor, then 
clutches his stomach in pain] except... children. Children can hear it. 
Sometimes, if their hearts are in the right place, and the stars are too. 
Children can hear your name. [struggles to get back on his feet] But nobody 
else. Nobody else. Ever. [gets back up again] Laugh hard! Run fast. Be kind. 
[pauses to compose himself] Doctor... I let you go."

born. It's terrifying. Right now I'm a stranger to myself. There's echoes of 
who I was and a sort of call towards who I am. And I have to hold my nerve and 
trust all these new instincts — shape myself towards them. I'll be fine, in 
the end. Hopefully. I have to be, because you guys need help. And if there's 
one thing I'm certain of, when people need help, I never refuse."

* Setting up Brother HL-5250DN

You need two AUR packages, installed in same order
- brother-hl5250dn-lpr
- brother-hl5250dn-cups-ppd



`git clone` both of them, then run `makepkg` followed by `makepkg --install` for each

`sudo systemctl restart cups`
[xx@yy ~]$ lpinfo -v

network dnssd://Brother%20HL-5250DN%20series._ipp._tcp.local/
network socket://192.168.X.YY

[xx@yy ~]$ lpadmin -p "Brother_HL5250DN" -v dnssd://Brother%20HL-5250DN%20series._ipp._tcp.local/
(or use Add printer at http://localhost:631/admin/)


[xx@yy ~]$ lpadmin -p "Brother_HL5250DN" -o pdftops-renderer-default=gs
Above command removes following complains in /var/log/cups/error_log
  [Job 1] Grayscale/monochrome printing requested for this job but Poppler is not able to convert to grayscale/monochrome PostScript.
  [Job 1] Use \"pdftops-renderer\" option (see cups-filters README file) to use Ghostscript or MuPDF for the PDF -> PostScript conversion.

Now open "Print settings" and
- Right-click your Brother_HL5250DN and 'Set As Default' (if you wish)
- Double-click it to open its settings. In Policies tab mark checkboxes 'Enabled' and 'Accepting jobs' 
(otherwise log file will contain  "Returning IPP server-error-not-accepting-jobs for Print-Job (ipp://localhost:631/printers/Brother_HL5250DN) from localhost")

You can now try to print (say something via browser).
I was asked for '.ppd' file and selected /etc/cups/ppd/Brother_HL5250DN.ppd
(Not sure for effects of selecting copy or use-in-place option, but selected 'copy')

You should be able to get your first print now.

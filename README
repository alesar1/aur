KNOWN BUILD ISSUES
=====
"Wno-deprecated-declarations" is used to suppress overflowing cpp warnings
when compiling against wxWidgets. A change in g++ to 5.1 has created this
situation.

gcc bug 65974 filed by wxWidgets maintainer:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65974

Build Warning:
src/wxsqlite3/wxsqlite3.cpp:3706:7: warning: variable ‘rc’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

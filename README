This is a modified version of the default Archlinux encrypt hook.
The only difference is that the cryptkey file from the commandline
is handled by tpm_unsealdata before it is passed to cryptosetup.

Fist the TPM has to be configured and trousers and tpm_tools
have to be installed.

To initialize the TPM run

# tpm_takeownership

Don't use either -y or -z these are the all-zero default
passwords. The Storage Root Key (SRK) password will be requestet on
every boot to open the encrypted LUKS key.

The SRK password can be changed with 

# tpm_changeownerauth -s

In order to create a valid key file run:

# tpm_sealdata --pcr 0 --pcr 1 --pcr 2 --pcr 3 --pcr 4 --pcr 8 --pcr 9 --pcr 12 --pcr 14 -o root.enc

where root.enc is the resulting encrypted file. Save it on your
EFI System Partition, and specifiy it in the kernel commandline:

cryptkey=/dev/sda1:vfat:/root.enc 

where /dev/sda1 is your ESP, and /root.enc the path to the key.

Modify /etc/mkinitcpio.conf and add the tpm hook
in the HOOKS array:

HOOKS="base udev keymap autodetect keyboard block tpm filesystems fsck"

(the same as with normal encrypt, you need to add keymap and keyboard
if you need support for either non US keyboards or keyboards that
require i.e. USB). Don't forget to add the filesystem dirver
from cryptkey= to the MODULES array

MODULES="vfat"

Now you can run mkinitcpio, to be save make a backup copy of your working
initram disk, so that you can use it if the new one is corrupt.

# mkinitcpio -p linux

If everything worked the scipt will ask for your SRK password.

In case a kernel update was performed or if a Firmware configuration
setting was changed, unsealdata will not return the LUKS key, and a
warning is displayed.

If you haven't changed something on your system, this warining could
indicate a possible evil maiden attack.

In order to continue booting the LUKS key has to
be supplied manually.

So it is IMHO best to have two LUKS keys configured, one that is typable
in case of an update, and one that is encrypted on the ESP.

After the LUKS key was manually entered, the key has to be reencrypted
with tpm_seal data as described before with the new PCR data.

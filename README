This package installs NordVPN's OpenVPN configuration files.
Additionally it allows the storage of your username and optionally
your password for automatic login. All OpenVPN configuration files are
located in /etc/openvpn/client.

To begin, you must put your username as the first line of
/etc/nordvpn.conf. You should make the file only accessible to
root as well. Optionally, put your password as the second line of
/etc/nordvpn.conf to enable auto login. Note that your
password will be stored in plain text!

Although NordVPN does offer protection against IPv6 leakage,
you should consider disabling it. [1,2] Ensure you are using NordVPN's
DNS servers. [3]

To run do pass the name of the configuration file to the
"openvpn-client" systemd unit [4]:

    # systemctl start openvpn-client@config-name

where config-name is the name of the configuration file. For example,
for us842.nordvpn.com.udp.conf do:

    # systemctl start openvpn-client@us842.nordvpn.com.udp

See /etc/openvpn/client for a list of files. To get a recommended
server visit [5]. To test your setup visit [6] and [7].

NordVPN does not version their files, but the pkgver() function in the
PKGBUILD will automatically get the last date the file was modified
and use it as your local package version. So if you believe your
package is out of date, do not flag the package. Simply run the
PKGBUILD script again. You may need to update the checksums in the
PKGBUILD when updating.

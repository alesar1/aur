This package installs Private Internet Access's OpenVPN configuration files.
Additionally it allows the storage of your username and optionally your password
for automatic login.

All OpenVPN configuration files are located in /etc/openvpn/client.


## SETUP

To begin, you must put your username as the first line of
/etc/openvpn-pia.conf. You should make the file only accessible to root
as well.

Optionally, put your password as the second line of /etc/openvpn-pia.conf
to enable auto login. Note that your password will be stored in plain
text!

**NOTE**: PIA does not support IPv6. Disable it:

**NOTE**: Ensure you are using PIA's DNS servers according to your setup.


## RUNNING

# systemctl start openvpn-client@config-name

where config-name is the name of the configuration file. For example,
for US-New-York-City.conf do:

# systemctl start openvpn-client@US-New-York-City

See /etc/openvpn/client for a list of files.

## UPDATING

PIA does not version their files, but you can check to see if the zip
file has been updated by doing:

    $ curl --head --silent https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/openvpn/openvpn-strong.zip | grep "Last-Modified"

If you notice the date is newer than the package date, please flag the
package as out of date.

Live Units
==========
These are mkinitcpio hooks that are split up from the "block" hook, and designed
for use for live, or other lightweight or specialty systems where this might
improve performance. This is the way that Arch did things eons ago. Chances are
you probably don't need this.

This is done for a handful of reasons. In a LiveOS we can save loading time, by
only loading drivers we absolutely need. We can also ensure that the internal
hard disk is kept out of early user space by not including the drivers. We can
fine tune what devices are in fact allowed in early user space

hooks:

live_usb - loads USB storage devices

live_mmc - loads SD card. NOTE that most sd card readers, but not all enumerate
	   as USB block devices. This was done early on for compatibility,
	   and licensing.(/dev/mmcblk* devices need this, /dev/sd* does not)

live_firewire - ieee1394 devices

live_virtual - virtualmachines use this

Pi-hole Archlinux configuration instructions
Standalone version
rev. 0.1

Instructions below assume ArchLinux default system config files are untouched


1) edit your /etc/resolvconf.conf and uncomment name_servers line (last line), update resolvconf:

# sed -i 's|#name_servers=127.0.0.1|name_servers=127.0.0.1|' /etc/resolvconf.conf
# resolvconf -u



*** if you already use dnsmasq and it's functional

2) copy pi-hole include config lines in right place

# mkdir /etc/dnsmasq.d
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.include /etc/dnsmasq.d/pihole.conf

3) edit your /etc/dnsmasq.conf to uncomment last line (including new pi-hole config lines)

# sed -i 's|#conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|' /etc/dnsmasq.conf

*** end if



*** if you installed dnsmasq with this package for the first time

4) backup original dnsmasq config file and copy pi-hole one

# cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.orig
# cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.complete /etc/dnsmasq.conf

*** end if



5) enable and start dnsmasq service

# systemctl enable dnsmasq.service
# systemctl restart dnsmasq.service



UNINSTALL steps

# systemctl stop dnsmasq.service
# systemctl disable dnsmasq.service
# sed -i 's|name_servers=127.0.0.1|#name_servers=127.0.0.1|' /etc/resolvconf.conf
# resolvconf -u
# [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.d/pihole.conf ] && rm /etc/dnsmasq.d/pihole.conf
# [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig ] && cp /etc/dnsmasq.orig /etc/dnsmasq.conf
